# Brandmine Archives

This directory contains detailed technical reports and documentation that extends beyond the core 4-document navigation system.

## Directory Structure

### `/reports/`
Emergency fixes and major system changes:
- Nuclear fixes with !important overrides
- Critical bug resolutions
- System-wide architectural changes

### `/technical-reports/`
Detailed technical documentation:
- Component analysis reports
- Architecture verification documents
- Performance optimization reports
- Code cleanup summaries

## Why Archives?

The core `_docs/` folder maintains exactly 4 documents for rapid navigation:
1. `brandmine-guide.md` - Master navigation hub
2. `setup-and-workflows.md` - Complete workflows
3. `technical-standards.md` - Architecture patterns
4. `troubleshooting-and-tools.md` - Problem resolution

Detailed reports that would clutter the main navigation are archived here for reference while maintaining the streamlined 4-document system.

## Accessing Archives

Archives are referenced from the main documentation when detailed information is needed. For example:
- Nuclear fixes are listed in `technical-standards.md` with links to detailed reports
- The master guide references the archives system for extended documentation

## Naming Conventions

- **Date-stamped reports**: `YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
- **Technical reports**: `category-specific-description.md`
- **Emergency fixes**: Include "nuclear-fix" in filename for easy searching
