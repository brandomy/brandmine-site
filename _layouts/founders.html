  LAYOUT: Founders
  PURPOSE: Main directory page for viewing and filtering all founder profiles
  USED BY: pages/{lang}/founders.md (founder discovery and listings)
  SECTIONS RENDERED: Data-driven via page_sections.yml (founders)
  FRONT MATTER REQUIRED: Standard page front matter, uses defaults from page_sections.yml
  PANEL SYSTEM: Uses panel--hero-split for hero, panel--primary for impact, panel--orange-soft for featured
  DEPENDENCIES: helpers/page-sections.html, _includes/pages/founders/[section].html, founders.js
  
  LOGIC-LIGHT ARCHITECTURE:
  - Standardized across all languages with identical section structure
  - Data-driven section rendering eliminates hardcoded logic
  - Impact section positioned before content for strategic messaging
  - Includes filter interface, founders grid, and featured founders
  - JavaScript handles dynamic filtering and search functionality
