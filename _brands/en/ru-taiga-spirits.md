## About Taiga Spirits

Founded in 2014 on the shores of Lake Baikal, Taiga Spirits has revitalized the tradition of Siberian botanical distillation through a combination of scientific precision and respect for ancient recipes. The company was established with a dual mission: to create world-class spirits that showcase the unique flavors of Siberia's vast wilderness and to preserve traditional knowledge of the region's medicinal and flavorful plants.

Operating from a purpose-built distillery in the village of Listvyanka, Taiga Spirits has developed a portfolio of premium vodkas and botanical spirits that have earned international acclaim for their exceptional quality and distinctive character. Each product reflects the company's deep connection to the Siberian taiga—the vast boreal forest that serves as both inspiration and source of ingredients.

What distinguishes Taiga Spirits is its scientific approach to traditional recipes. The company maintains a botanical laboratory where ingredients are analyzed for flavor compounds and medicinal properties, allowing for precise formulation while honoring traditional methods. This combination of innovation and heritage has positioned Taiga Spirits at the forefront of Russia's craft spirits movement and increasingly on the radar of international spirits connoisseurs.

## Founder's Journey

Nikolai Volkov's path to becoming a distiller was shaped by his background as a field biologist specializing in the flora of Siberia. After earning his doctorate from Irkutsk State University, Volkov spent a decade leading scientific expeditions throughout the region, documenting plant species and their traditional uses by indigenous communities.

"I became fascinated by the knowledge of local elders who could identify hundreds of plants and their properties," Volkov explains. "Many of them shared stories about spirits their grandparents made—not just for enjoyment but as medicine and a way to preserve the flavors of short Siberian summers through the long winters."

This interest became a passion when Volkov discovered his own grandfather's handwritten distillation journals from the 1930s, which contained detailed recipes using local botanicals. "These weren't just recipes but a record of our cultural heritage that was disappearing," he says. Using his scientific background and these historical documents, Volkov began experimenting with small-batch distillation in 2012.

## Market Presence

Taiga Spirits has established a distinctive position in Russia's growing craft spirits market with distribution across major Russian cities and particular strength in Siberian and Far Eastern regions. The brand's products are featured in over 180 premium restaurants and specialty liquor retailers throughout the country.

The company operates a flagship distillery and tasting room in Listvyanka, a brand store in Irkutsk's historic district, and a recently opened concept shop in Moscow featuring an educational "Taiga Botanical Bar." The distillery itself has become a popular destination for tourists visiting Lake Baikal, with guided tours and tasting experiences offered daily.

Internationally, Taiga Spirits has begun expanding into select markets, with current distribution in China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Germany. The brand's distinctive packaging and authentic Russian taiga storytelling have resonated particularly well with consumers seeking authentic cultural experiences, especially in Asian luxury markets where Russian craft spirits are still a novelty.
