## About TeaTime

Founded in 2010 by tea enthusiast Alexei Sokolov, TeaTime has become one of Russia's premier artisanal tea brands. The company combines traditional Russian tea culture with innovative blending techniques to create distinctive flavor profiles.

After spending a decade in finance, Sokolov decided to pursue his passion for tea following several trips to major tea-producing regions in China and India. TeaTime began as a small specialty store in Moscow and has since grown to become Russia's most recognized premium tea brand, with products now available in select European markets.

## Founder's Journey

Alexei Sokolov's path to becoming a tea entrepreneur began with a transformative trip to China's Yunnan province in 2008. Disillusioned with his banking career during the financial crisis, he spent three months studying under tea masters in both China and India, learning the delicate art of tea blending and appreciation.

"I realized that Russia had a rich tea culture dating back centuries, but little innovation in recent decades," explains Sokolov. "I saw an opportunity to honor our traditions while introducing contemporary techniques and flavors that would appeal to modern consumers." Starting with personal savings and a small family loan, Sokolov opened the first TeaTime location in 2010, focusing on education and customer experience alongside product excellence.

## Product Range

TeaTime offers a diverse collection of tea blends featuring locally sourced herbs and berries:

- **Siberian Frost**: Signature black tea with pine and juniper notes, designed to evoke the crisp air of Russian winters. Each batch is aged for 60 days in pine barrels.
- **Moscow Sunrise**: Energizing breakfast blend with citrus undertones, combining robust Assam leaves with subtle bergamot and orange peel.
- **Taiga Nights**: Calming herbal infusion with honey and wild berries, hand-harvested from Russia's northern forests. Contains no caffeine and is popular as an evening relaxation tea.

## Market Presence

TeaTime has established a strong domestic presence across Russia's major urban centers:

- **Home Market**: Seven company-owned stores across Moscow and St. Petersburg, with products available in over 200 high-end grocery and specialty food shops throughout Russia.
- **Key Regions**: Particularly strong presence in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg, with growing distribution in Siberian cities.
- **Flagship Locations**: The brand's Moscow flagship store on Tverskaya Street has become a destination for tea enthusiasts, featuring tasting rooms and educational workshops.
