## About TeaTime

TeaTime has established itself as Russia's premier artisanal tea brand, combining traditional Chinese and Indian tea cultivation knowledge with distinctly Russian flavors and blending techniques. What began as informal tea gatherings in Moscow State University dormitories has transformed into an international brand reaching markets across Europe, Asia, and North America.

## Founder's Journey

Alexei Sokolov discovered his passion for tea while traveling through China as a student. Returning to Moscow with newfound knowledge and a collection of rare teas, he began hosting tea ceremonies that quickly became legendary among students. His unique approach to tea blending, incorporating Russian herbs and berries with traditional Asian teas, created flavors that resonated deeply with Russian tastes while maintaining international appeal.

## Product Range

TeaTime's signature blends include the award-winning "Moscow Nights" - a black tea infused with blackcurrant and mint, and "Siberian Forest" - featuring wild herbs and pine needles. The brand has expanded beyond traditional teas to include innovative cold brews, tea-based cocktail mixers, and a premium line of tea accessories.

## Market Presence

From its flagship store in central Moscow, TeaTime has grown to include locations in St. Petersburg, Kazan, and Vladivostok. The brand's international presence spans 23 countries, with particularly strong markets in the UK (where it's featured in Harrods), France, Germany, Japan, and Singapore. TeaTime's success demonstrates the global appetite for authentic, story-driven premium beverages that bridge cultural traditions.
