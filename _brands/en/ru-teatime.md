## About TeaTime

TeaTime has established itself as Moscow's premier artisanal tea brand, offering exceptional blends that combine traditional Russian tea culture with contemporary flavors and presentation. Founded in the late 1990s during a period of cultural renaissance in Moscow, the brand quickly gained recognition for its meticulous sourcing and innovative approaches to traditional tea service.

## Founder's Journey

Alexei Sokolov discovered his passion for tea while traveling through China and India as a young entrepreneur. Returning to Moscow with extensive knowledge of tea cultivation and preparation techniques, he established TeaTime with a vision of elevating Russian tea culture. His background in both business and culinary arts has shaped the brand's distinctive approach to tea as both a premium product and an immersive cultural experience.

## Market Presence

The brand operates three flagship tea houses in Moscow's cultural districts, along with a growing wholesale business supplying premium hotels and restaurants throughout Russia. TeaTime has recently begun expanding into international markets, focusing on premium department stores and specialty food retailers in Europe and Asia. The brand's distinctive packaging and authentic Russian tea culture storytelling have resonated particularly well with consumers seeking authentic cultural experiences.
