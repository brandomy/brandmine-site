## About Serra Verde Organics

Serra Verde Organics has evolved from a traditional family farm into one of Brazil's most respected producers of organic preserves, honeys, and specialty coffees. Located in the mountainous Serra da Mantiqueira region of Minas Gerais state, the company's 175-hectare property combines productive agroforestry zones with protected Atlantic Forest reserves—one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots.

Founded in 1986 when Eduardo Santos took over his family's conventional farm, Serra Verde pioneered organic and regenerative agricultural practices in a region known for its rich agricultural heritage but increasingly threatened by unsustainable farming methods. What began as a small operation selling homemade preserves at local markets has grown into an internationally recognized brand whose products are featured in specialty food stores across South America and beyond.

The company remains deeply rooted in its founding philosophy of "preservation through production"—the belief that sustainable economic activity is essential for conservation. Today, Serra Verde works with a network of 28 family farms in the region who follow its rigorous organic protocols, creating rural livelihoods while preserving the unique ecosystem and culinary traditions of the Serra da Mantiqueira.

## Founder's Journey

Eduardo Santos represents the third generation of his family to farm the mountainous terrain of southern Minas Gerais. After studying agronomy in São Paulo during the early 1980s, he returned home with new ideas about sustainable agriculture that challenged the conventional practices of his father and grandfather.

"When I took over the farm in 1986, the soil was depleted from decades of monoculture and chemical inputs," Santos explains. "Our yields were declining, and I was seeing fewer birds and insects each year." Inspired by the emerging organic movement and Brazil's early agroecology pioneers, Santos began transitioning sections of the farm to organic methods, starting with native fruit orchards.

The transformation wasn't easy. "My father thought I was destroying his legacy," Santos recalls. "The first few years were difficult as we relearned how to work with nature rather than against it." The turning point came in 1992 when Santos' wife, Maria, began transforming excess organic fruit into preserves using her grandmother's recipes. Their preserves quickly gained popularity at farmers' markets in nearby towns and eventually in specialty stores in São Paulo.

"What started as a way to reduce waste became our pathway to financial sustainability," says Santos. This initial success allowed the couple to gradually convert the entire farm to organic methods and begin working with neighboring farmers interested in similar transitions.

## Product Range

Serra Verde's product portfolio includes three primary categories, all produced using organic, sustainably harvested ingredients:

- **Fruit Preserves**: The company's flagship products feature single-origin fruits grown in their agroforestry system. Signature varieties include Rainforest Passion Fruit, Mountain Strawberry, and Atlantic Guava, all made with organic unrefined cane sugar and traditional slow-cooking methods. Special editions feature seasonal fruits like jabuticaba (Brazilian grape tree) and cambuci (native Amazonian fruit).

- **Wild and Cultivated Honeys**: Serra Verde manages 120 beehives using sustainable apiculture practices and partners with local communities for wild honey collection. Their award-winning varieties include Atlantic Forest Wildflower, Organic Eucalyptus Blossom, and rare Green Propolis honey, known for its medicinal properties.

- **Specialty Coffee**: Shade-grown arabica coffee cultivated under the forest canopy produces a distinctive smooth, complex flavor profile. Available as whole beans or ground, the company's coffees have received specialty grade ratings of 85+ and feature notes of chocolate, citrus, and nuts characteristic of high-elevation Minas Gerais coffees.

## Market Presence

Serra Verde has established a strong presence in Brazil's premium organic food sector while gradually expanding internationally:

- **Home Market**: Products are available in over 300 specialty food retailers throughout Brazil, including major organic supermarket chains in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. The brand operates a flagship store and café at the farm property, which attracts culinary tourists and serves as a demonstration site for sustainable agriculture.

- **Key Regions**: Particularly strong presence in southeastern Brazil, with growing distribution in the northeastern tourist regions. The company has established partnerships with high-end hotels and restaurants in major Brazilian cities featuring farm-to-table cuisine.

- **Production Facilities**: The main processing facility in Gonçalves handles preserve production and honey processing, while coffee processing takes place at a specialized facility in nearby Carmo de Minas, a region renowned for its specialty coffee production.
