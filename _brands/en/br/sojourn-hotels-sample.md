## About Sojourn Boutique Hotels

Founded in 2012, Sojourn Boutique Hotels represents a new vision for Brazilian hospitality – one that celebrates the country's incredible diversity through intimate, sustainable luxury experiences. What began as a single 16-room boutique property in historic Paraty has evolved into a collection of five distinctive hotels, each designed to immerse guests in the unique character of its location while maintaining a unifying commitment to authentic local experiences and environmental stewardship.

Each Sojourn property is created through careful restoration of historic buildings or low-impact new construction using local materials and traditional building techniques. The brand's philosophy centers on the concept of "sense of place" – the belief that a hotel should serve as a gateway to experiencing a region's culture, cuisine, and natural environment in ways that benefit local communities.

With strategically located properties along Brazil's coast and in its spectacular inland regions, Sojourn has established itself as the country's leading boutique hotel brand for conscious travelers seeking meaningful connections with Brazil's diverse landscapes and cultures.

## Founder's Journey

Isabela Mendez's path to founding Sojourn began during her fifteen-year career with a major international hotel chain, where she rose to regional director overseeing operations across South America. Despite her success in corporate hospitality, Mendez became increasingly frustrated by standardized approaches that failed to showcase Brazil's rich diversity.

"I kept seeing foreign tourists staying in properties that could have been anywhere in the world," Mendez explains. "They were visiting one of the most culturally and ecologically rich countries on the planet but experiencing none of it within their accommodations." After a transformative sabbatical spent traveling Brazil's lesser-known regions, Mendez developed the concept for Sojourn – a collection of properties that would serve as gateways to authentic Brazilian experiences.

Starting with personal savings and investment from family members, Mendez purchased and renovated a historic building in the coastal colonial town of Paraty. "I wanted to create spaces where the boundaries between the hotel and its surroundings were permeable – where guests could truly feel connected to the place," she says. This founding principle continues to guide the brand's approach to property development and guest experiences.

## Property Portfolio

Sojourn's collection currently features five distinctive properties, each reflecting its local environment:

- **Sojourn Paraty**: A restored 19th-century townhouse in the historic center of coastal Paraty featuring 16 rooms with colonial architecture and contemporary Brazilian design. Signature experiences include sailing excursions to secluded beaches and culinary workshops focused on traditional caiçara cuisine.

- **Sojourn Chapada Diamantina**: Set at the edge of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia, this 22-room mountain lodge offers access to some of Brazil's most spectacular hiking trails and waterfalls. The property features private bungalows built with sustainable materials and a renowned plant-based restaurant.

- **Sojourn Trancoso**: Located in the bohemian beach town of Trancoso, Bahia, this 18-room property combines rustic charm with sophisticated coastal style. The hotel centers around a restored quadrado (town square) house with additional garden casitas.

- **Sojourn Ibitipoca**: A converted fazenda (farm) near Ibitipoca State Park in Minas Gerais, featuring 14 rooms in historic farm buildings. The property includes a working organic farm that supplies its award-winning restaurant.

- **Sojourn Alto Paraíso**: The newest addition to the collection, opened in 2023 in Alto Paraíso de Goiás near Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park. This 20-room property showcases contemporary cerrado (savanna) architecture and focuses on wellness programming.

## Market Presence

Sojourn has established a strategic presence across Brazil's most distinctive regions:

- **Home Market**: Five owner-operated properties across four states (Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Goiás), with a headquarters office in Rio de Janeiro managing centralized marketing, reservations, and development.

- **Key Regions**: Concentrated in areas combining natural beauty, cultural significance, and growing tourism demand, with a particular focus on UNESCO World Heritage sites and regions near national parks.

- **Flagship Location**: The original Paraty property remains the brand's flagship, embodying its commitment to historic preservation and serving as a training center for new property staff.

- **Regional Context**: Sojourn's strategy targets regions that combine natural beauty, cultural heritage, and growing tourism infrastructure. The brand specifically seeks locations that offer a distinctive sense of place while remaining accessible to international and domestic travelers.

- **Nearby Brands**: The Paraty and Trancoso properties operate in close proximity to Terra Brasil Tours, which often incorporates Sojourn properties into its luxury itineraries. The Alto Paraíso property neighbors several wellness retreats and natural food producers, including Amazonia Organics.

- **Strategic Position**: The current portfolio creates a distinctive circuit of properties allowing travelers to experience Brazil's remarkable diversity – from coastal colonial towns to mountain ranges, tropical beaches, and savanna landscapes – while maintaining a consistent standard of service and sustainability.
