## About Seven Spices of Siberia

Seven Spices of Siberia bridges the culinary traditions of Central Asia with modern Russian cuisine through expertly crafted spice blends. Founded by Maria Kuznetsova in 2012, this Novosibirsk-based company has revolutionized how Russians experience authentic flavors from the historic Silk Road trading routes.

## The Siberian Spice Renaissance

Drawing from her grandmother's recipe collection and extensive travels through Central Asia, Maria identified an opportunity to bring authentic spice blending traditions to contemporary Russian kitchens. Her signature "Siberian Seven" blend combines locally foraged herbs with imported spices, creating complex flavor profiles that complement both traditional Russian dishes and modern fusion cuisine.

## Founder's Vision

Maria Kuznetsova's journey began during university studies in cultural anthropology, where she researched the historical spice trade routes through Siberia. Her academic background, combined with family culinary traditions, inspired her to create a brand that celebrates the multicultural heritage of the region while meeting modern quality and convenience standards.

## Artisanal Craft

Each Seven Spices blend is hand-mixed in small batches using traditional techniques passed down through generations. The company sources premium ingredients directly from farmers across Central Asia, ensuring authenticity and supporting traditional agricultural communities. All blends undergo rigorous quality testing to maintain consistency across production runs.

## Product Innovation

Beyond traditional blends, Seven Spices has developed modern applications including marinades, finishing salts, and specialty tea blends. The company's recipe blog and cooking classes have built a loyal community of home cooks eager to explore the rich flavors of Eurasian cuisine.

## Regional Impact

Seven Spices has become a catalyst for culinary tourism in Novosibirsk, partnering with local restaurants to showcase Central Asian-inspired cuisine. The brand's success has also created economic opportunities for spice farmers across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan through its direct sourcing partnerships.
