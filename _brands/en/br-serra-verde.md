## About Serra Verde Organics

Serra Verde Organics is a family-owned producer specializing in organic preserves, honeys, and specialty coffees from Brazil's Atlantic Forest region. Founded in 1986 when Eduardo Santos transformed his family's conventional farm into a pioneering organic operation, the company now works with a network of 28 family farms following rigorous organic protocols.

## Founder's Journey

Eduardo Santos represents the third generation of his family to farm the mountainous terrain of southern Minas Gerais. After studying agronomy in São Paulo, he returned home with new ideas about sustainable agriculture that challenged conventional practices. His transformation of depleted farmland into a thriving organic operation has made Serra Verde a leader in Brazil's sustainable food movement.

## Market Presence

The brand operates locally in its home region through independent retailers and has begun expanding into specialty food stores in major Brazilian cities. Their organic coffee and fruit preserves have gained particular recognition for exceptional quality, with limited export operations to specialty food retailers in Portugal and Spain. Serra Verde also operates a small farm shop and cafe that has become a popular destination for eco-tourists visiting the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain region.
