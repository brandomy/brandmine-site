## About Taiga Spirits

Founded in 2014 on the shores of Lake Baikal, Taiga Spirits has revitalized the tradition of Siberian botanical distillation through a combination of scientific precision and respect for ancient recipes. The company was established with a dual mission: to create world-class spirits that showcase the unique flavors of Siberia's vast wilderness and to preserve traditional knowledge of the region's medicinal and flavorful plants.

Operating from a purpose-built distillery in the village of Listvyanka, Taiga Spirits has developed a portfolio of premium vodkas and botanical spirits that have earned international acclaim for their exceptional quality and distinctive character. Each product reflects the company's deep connection to the Siberian taiga—the vast boreal forest that serves as both inspiration and source of ingredients.

What distinguishes Taiga Spirits is its scientific approach to traditional recipes. The company maintains a botanical laboratory where ingredients are analyzed for flavor compounds and medicinal properties, allowing for precise formulation while honoring traditional methods. This combination of innovation and heritage has positioned Taiga Spirits at the forefront of Russia's craft spirits movement and increasingly on the radar of international spirits connoisseurs.

## Founder's Journey

Nikolai Volkov's path to becoming a distiller was shaped by his background as a field biologist specializing in the flora of Siberia. After earning his doctorate from Irkutsk State University, Volkov spent a decade leading scientific expeditions throughout the region, documenting plant species and their traditional uses by indigenous communities.

"I became fascinated by the knowledge of local elders who could identify hundreds of plants and their properties," Volkov explains. "Many of them shared stories about spirits their grandparents made—not just for enjoyment but as medicine and a way to preserve the flavors of short Siberian summers through the long winters."

This interest became a passion when Volkov discovered his own grandfather's handwritten distillation journals from the 1930s, which contained detailed recipes using local botanicals. "These weren't just recipes but a record of our cultural heritage that was disappearing," he says. Using his scientific background and these historical documents, Volkov began experimenting with small-batch distillation in 2012.

After two years of research and experimentation, Volkov established Taiga Spirits in a converted woodworking shop with a single copper still. "I started with just three products and sold them at local markets," he recalls. "The response was immediate—people recognized something authentic in these flavors, something that connected them to this place and its traditions."

## Product Range

Taiga Spirits produces three distinct product lines, all created in small batches using traditional methods and locally sourced ingredients:

- **Signature Vodkas**: The company's foundation is a collection of premium vodkas infused with Siberian botanicals. Their flagship Cedar & Honeysuckle Vodka is distilled from local wheat and filtered through cedar charcoal before being infused with wild honeysuckle blossoms. Other notable varieties include Siberian Pine Nut Vodka and Lake Baikal Crystal, which uses water from the world's deepest freshwater lake.

- **Taiga Botanical Spirits**: A collection of spirits inspired by traditional Siberian medicinal alcohols. These higher-proof products (45-55% ABV) feature intense botanical flavors from ingredients like Siberian ginseng, chaga mushroom, and wild rosehips. The award-winning Taiga Hunter's Spirit combines 23 foraged herbs and is based on a recipe traditionally carried by hunters for both warmth and medicinal purposes.

- **Baikal Deep Collection**: Limited edition spirits featuring rare endemic plants found only in the Lake Baikal region. These premium products are released in numbered batches of 500 bottles and have become collectors' items. Each bottle includes detailed information about the featured botanical and its significance in local ecology and traditional medicine.

## Market Presence
