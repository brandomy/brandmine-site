## Architecture Notes

This template uses Brandmine's centralized section control system:

- **Layout**: market-sector automatically loads appropriate sections
- **Configuration**: Section order and behavior defined in _data/page_sections.yml
- **Consistency**: All market-sector pages use identical section structure

No manual section configuration is needed in the front matter.
