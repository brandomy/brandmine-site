# Founder Profile Creation Tutorial

**Complete guide to creating rich founder profiles in the Brandmine system**

---

## üéØ Overview

Founder profiles showcase the visionaries behind BRICS+ brands, emphasizing their personal journeys, expertise, and cross-border capabilities. The system uses a sophisticated architecture with bidirectional brand relationships and comprehensive validation.

### "Logic Light" Architecture
Founder profiles implement Brandmine's configuration-driven "Logic Light" patterns:
- **Data-driven sections** configured in `_data/page_sections.yml`
- **Centralized component defaults** via `_data/component_defaults.yml`
- **Section rendering** through `helpers/page-sections.html`
- **Minimal template logic** with maximum configurability
- **Consistent patterns** shared across all profile types

### Architecture Highlights
- **Bidirectional brand relationships** with cross-validation
- **Generation-based categorization** (1st, 2nd, 3rd Gen, Transition)
- **Cross-border expertise tracking** for international expansion
- **Multilingual support** across EN/RU/ZH
- **Expertise cloud visualization** with skill tagging
- **Social media integration** for professional networking

## üèóÔ∏è Founder Profile Architecture

### Data Sources
Founder profiles use a hybrid data system:
1. **YAML collections** - Rich markdown content with full section support
2. **JSON index** - Generated search data for performance
3. **Cross-references** - Bidirectional links with brand profiles

### Page Structure
```
Layout: founder-profile.html ‚Üí helpers/page-sections.html ‚Üí pages/founder/[section].html
```

# Alexei Sokolov: Bridging Tradition and Innovation in Russian Tea Culture

Born into a family where tea was more than a beverage‚Äîit was a way of life‚ÄîAlexei Sokolov represents the third generation of tea artisans who have dedicated their lives to preserving and evolving Russian tea traditions.

## A Legacy Rooted in Tradition

Alexei's journey began at age seven in his grandfather's tea workshop, where he learned that every blend tells a story. His grandfather, Viktor Sokolov, had established the family tea estate in 1952, developing unique blending techniques that combined traditional Russian preferences with influences from across the Silk Road.

"Tea is not just about flavor," Alexei explains. "It's about creating moments of connection‚Äîbetween cultures, between generations, between people who share a cup together."

## The Modern Tea Master

After completing his studies in Agricultural Sciences at Moscow State University, Alexei spent a decade working within the family business, learning every aspect of tea cultivation, processing, and blending. His international perspective was shaped by extensive travels across China, Japan, and India, where he studied traditional tea production methods.

## Building Bridges Across Borders

In 2018, Alexei founded TeaTime with a clear mission: to introduce the world to authentic Russian tea culture while respecting the traditions of tea-producing regions worldwide. His cross-border expertise has been instrumental in establishing partnerships with tea gardens across Asia and distribution networks throughout Europe.

### Key Achievements

- **International Recognition**: Gold Medal at the World Tea Championship (2022)
- **Export Success**: Built distribution in 15 countries across Asia and Europe
- **Sustainability Leadership**: Implemented carbon-neutral tea processing
- **Cultural Preservation**: Established Tea Culture Museum in Moscow

## Philosophy and Vision

Alexei believes that tea masters have a responsibility to preserve traditional knowledge while embracing innovation that benefits both producers and consumers. His approach combines:

- **Traditional Blending**: Hand-crafted recipes passed down through generations
- **Sustainable Sourcing**: Direct trade relationships with tea gardens
- **Cultural Exchange**: Educational programs connecting Russian and Asian tea traditions
- **Modern Marketing**: Digital platforms to reach global audiences

## The Next Generation

As a mentor to young entrepreneurs through the Young Entrepreneurs Tea Academy, Alexei is passionate about passing on not just technical knowledge, but the cultural values that make tea a bridge between communities.

"Every cup of tea we create should honor the farmers who grew it, the traditions that shaped it, and the people who will share it," Alexei reflects. "That's how we build lasting business relationships that transcend borders."

### Step 3: Add Inspirational Quotes (Optional)

The founder quote card system allows you to showcase powerful quotes that capture the founder's philosophy, vision, or business insights. Add quotes to the front matter:

```yaml
quotes:
  - text: "Your inspirational quote here"
    type: "philosophy"  # Options: "vision", "philosophy", "advice", "insight"
    context: "Context about when or why this was said"
  - text: "Another meaningful quote"
    type: "advice"
    context: "Additional context"
```

**Quote Types:**
- `vision` - Future-focused statements about company direction
- `philosophy` - Core beliefs about business/industry
- `advice` - Guidance for other entrepreneurs  
- `insight` - Key learnings from experience

**Best Practices:**
- Use 1-3 quotes maximum per founder
- Keep quotes under 200 characters for optimal display
- Provide meaningful context that adds value
- Choose quotes that differentiate the founder's perspective

The quotes will automatically appear in the "Words of Wisdom" section on founder profiles across all languages (EN/RU/ZH).

### Step 4: Set Up Image Structure

Create image directories:
```bash
mkdir -p assets/images/founders/ru-alexei-sokolov/originals/
```

Add source images following Brandmine standards:
- `portrait.jpg` - 2:3 aspect ratio (800√ó1200px), JPG for featured displays
- `headshot.jpg` - 1:1 aspect ratio (800√ó800px), JPG for card displays

### Step 5: Process Images

```bash
# Process all founder images with responsive versions
_scripts/core/process_images.sh founders ru-alexei-sokolov
```

This generates:
- `portrait-400w.jpg`, `portrait-800w.jpg`, `portrait-1200w.jpg`
- `headshot-400w.jpg`, `headshot-800w.jpg`, `headshot-1200w.jpg`

### Step 6: Update Data Indexes

```bash
# Generate updated founders JSON index with validation
python3 _scripts/data-generation/generate-founders-json.py --verbose --validate
```

This updates `_data/founders.json` and validates brand cross-references.

### Step 7: Link to Brand Profiles

Ensure the brands referenced in the founder's `brands` array also reference this founder:

**In `_brands/en/ru-teatime.md`:**
```yaml
founder:
  name: "Alexei Sokolov"
  ref: "ru-alexei-sokolov"  # Links to founder profile
  position: "CEO & Tea Master"
  story: "Third-generation tea master"
  generation: "3rd Generation"
  founder_led: true
```
