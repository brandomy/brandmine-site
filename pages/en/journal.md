Welcome to the Founder's Journal, where we share our journey building Brandmine and our ongoing mission to illuminate exceptional founder-led brands from the BRICS+ countries.

This is where we document our learning process, share insights from our exploration of emerging markets, and reflect on the challenges and discoveries that shape our platform. From technical deep-dives on tools like MapLibre to cultural insights gained through our brand research, these entries offer a transparent look at building a business intelligence platform for underrepresented markets.

Join us as we navigate the complexities of cross-cultural brand storytelling and work to bridge the gaps between visionary founders and the global opportunities they deserve.
