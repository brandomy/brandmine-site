Welcome to the Founder's Journal, where we share our journey building Brandmine and our ongoing mission to illuminate exceptional founder-led brands from the Global South.

This is where we document our learning process, share insights from our exploration of emerging markets, and reflect on the challenges and discoveries that shape our platform. From technical deep-dives on tools like MapLibre to cultural insights gained through our brand research, these entries offer a transparent look at building a business intelligence platform for underrepresented markets.

Join us as we navigate the complexities of cross-cultural brand storytelling and work to bridge the gaps between visionary founders and the global opportunities they deserve.
