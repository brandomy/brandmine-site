# üß≠ Project Overview

**Brandmine** is a multilingual, mobile-first website built with **Jekyll (no theme)** that showcases narrative-rich consumer brands from BRICS+ countries. It emphasizes founder stories, multidimensional tagging, and interactive discovery.

The site supports:
- **Three languages**: English (`en`), Russian (`ru`), Chinese (`zh`)
- A **dimension-based discovery model** (sector, attribute, signal, market)
- Custom includes for maps, dimension clouds, related brand logic, and language switching
- Integration with MapLibre for interactive maps
- Planned integration with Airtable (flat table structure)

---

# üè∑Ô∏è Dimensions System

Dimensions are stored as Markdown files in `_dimensions/{lang}/{type}/`. Each file contains:
- A front matter section with name, slug, type, and optionally description
- Content describing the dimension in more detail

**Valid dimension types** include:
- `sectors` ‚Äî e.g. natural-beauty, halal-foods, specialty-cheeses, wine
- `attributes` ‚Äî e.g. founder-led, heritage-brand, sustainability-pioneer
- `signals` ‚Äî e.g. export-ready, franchise-ready, rapid-growth
- `markets` ‚Äî e.g. russia, brazil, india, china

Brands reference dimensions in front matter like this:

```yaml
---
title: BioGlow
lang: en
sector: natural-beauty
dimensions: [organic, india, founder-led]
---
```

Rendering includes:
- `dimension-cloud.html`, `dimension-list.html`, `related-brands-list.html`

---

# üìÅ Includes Organization

Includes are organized into a structured hierarchy:

```
/_includes/
  collections/          ‚Äî Collection-specific includes
    brands/             ‚Äî Brand-related includes
    dimensions/         ‚Äî Dimension-related includes
    insights/           ‚Äî Insight-related includes

  styleguide/           ‚Äî Styleguide components
  utilities/            ‚Äî Utility includes
```

This organization mirrors the CSS structure for consistency and maintainability.

---

# üåê Multilingual Logic

- **All content exists in language-specific subfolders**: `/en/`, `/ru/`, `/zh/`
- `_data/translations/{lang}.yml` stores UI labels and common text strings
- `_data/navigation/{lang}.yml` configures nav structure per language
- Layouts and includes dynamically pull from `_data/` based on `page.lang`
- Language switcher and all permalinks respect language prefixing

---

# üó∫Ô∏è Map Integration

- Using **MapLibre** with **Stadia Maps** for geographic visualization
- Clustering for efficient display of large numbers of brands
- Brand points link to their respective profile pages
- Filtering capabilities aligned with taxonomy system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

---

# üé® Brand Display Components

Key components for brand display include:
- `brand-card.html` - Card display for brand listings
- `brand-list-item.html` - List view display for brand listings
- `search-filter.html` - Filter interface for multi-dimensional discovery
- `brand-image.html` - Responsive image handling for brand imagery
- `map-component.html` - Geographic visualization of brands

These components implement a visual taxonomy system using consistent color-coding:
- Sectors -> mint green/olive
- Markets -> light blue
- Attributes -> light orange
- Signals -> light purple/accent

---

# üìä Two-Tier Content Approach

Brandmine uses a two-tier approach for brand content:
- **Tier 1: Basic Listings** (100+ per sector)
  - Name, location, sector
  - Brief description
  - Basic taxonomy
  - Geographic coordinates

- **Tier 2: Feature Profiles** (2-3 per sector)
  - Rich founder narratives
  - High-quality imagery
  - Complete taxonomy
  - Timeline and milestones

# üé® Code Style Guidelines

## Layout Width Strategy
- **Home page**: Full-width layout for maximum visual impact
- **Interior pages**: Max-width of 1200px for content areas
- **Panel content**: Standard 1200px max-width for consistency across pages
- **Responsive behavior**: Widths automatically adjust on smaller screens
- This strategy balances:
  - Using screen real estate effectively on modern large displays
  - Maintaining readability for text-heavy content
  - Creating visual hierarchy between landing pages and interior content
  - Providing consistent user experience across different sections

## CSS
- Follows **BEM naming**: `Block__Element--Modifier`
- Mobile-first with defined breakpoints
- Organized with a manifest system for better modularity
- Uses CSS custom properties for design tokens
- File organization:
  - `/assets/css/tokens/` - Design variables, typography, grid definitions
  - `/assets/css/base/` - Core styling elements (layout, typography)
  - `/assets/css/layout/` - Layout components (header, footer, panels)
  - `/assets/css/components/` - UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.) with subdirectories:
    - `/cards/` - Various card components
    - `/carousels/` - Carousel components
    - `/navigation/` - Navigation elements
    - `/search/` - Search interfaces
    - `/dimension/` - Dimension-related components
  - `/assets/css/collections/` - Collection-specific styles:
    - `/brands/` - Brand collection styling
    - `/dimensions/` - Dimension collection styling
    - `/insights/` - Insight collection styling
    - `/markets/` - Market collection styling
  - `/assets/css/pages/` - Page-specific styling
    - `/dimension-specific/` - Styles for specific dimension pages
  - `/assets/css/manifest/` - CSS import manifests that group related styles
  - `/assets/css/utils/` - Utility styles

## HTML
- Semantic HTML5
- BEM class structure
- `id`s used for JS targeting
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Use includes for reusable components
- Respect content hierarchy with proper heading levels
- Keep language-specific content in the appropriate language subfolder

## JavaScript
- Vanilla JS only (no frameworks)
- ES6 preferred, backwards-compatible
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation
- Use event delegation for dynamic elements
- Keep scripts modular, limited to specific functionality
- Ensure all scripts are compatible with multilingual content

## Markdown/Front Matter
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include language code in all content files
- Ensure all dimensions are properly referenced and exist as dimension files
- For brand files, include all required frontmatter (title, slug, country, etc.)
- For translated content, keep the same structure across languages

## Error Handling
- Use Jekyll's multilingual fallback system for missing translations
- Validate language consistency with checking script before commits
- Handle missing images gracefully with responsive image component

---

# üñºÔ∏è Image Strategy

- Standardized naming conventions (`purpose-imagename.jpg`)
- **Standard 3:2 aspect ratio** for most content images (1200√ó800px)
- Responsive image sizes (400w, 800w, 1200w, 1600w)
- Organization by brand in the assets directory
- Processing with ImageMagick for optimization via dedicated scripts:
  - `process_brand_images.sh` for brand assets
  - `process_site_images.sh` for site assets
  - `process_people_images.sh` for people/team images

## Visual Style Strategy

Brandmine applies a structured visual language for all imagery based on content type:

- **Textured Minimalism (TM):**  
  Used for brand profile hero images, insights article hero images, and country-specific dimension pages (e.g., Russian sectors, Brazilian markets).  
  Characteristics: simplified forms, subtle textures, gentle shadows, rich muted colors, no embedded text.

- **Muted Pastel Textured Minimalism (MPTM):**  
  Used for inline illustrations within insights articles and brand profiles to create emotional breathing spaces.  
  Characteristics: pastel-based color palette, soft textures, lighter emotional tone, clean simplified forms.

- **Flat Colour Minimalism:**  
  Used for generic dimension pages (e.g., global sector overviews, signals, attributes, markets).  
  Characteristics: bold flat colors, geometric abstraction, no textures, clean edges, strong contrast for quick discovery.

- **Photographic Portrait Stylization (MPTM Adaptation):**  
  Founder portraits and selected artisan process shots are stylized into MPTM to maintain a cohesive aesthetic while preserving human authenticity.

General Rule:  
- Use TM for primary storytelling heroes.  
- Use MPTM for secondary storytelling illustrations.  
- Use Flat Colour Minimalism for taxonomy navigation and abstract dimension discovery.

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid mixing raw unprocessed photographs with stylized or illustrated content directly side-by-side. All imagery must maintain consistent visual processing to preserve Brandmine's premium, editorial aesthetic.

---

# üì± Mobile Optimization & Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach for all components
- Standardized breakpoints used consistently across all CSS:
  - `min-width: 480px` - Small devices
  - `min-width: 768px` - Medium devices (tablets)
  - `min-width: 992px` - Large devices (desktops)
- Write mobile styles first, then enhance for larger screens within media queries
- Critical for Russian and Chinese markets where mobile usage dominates
- Card layouts designed for touch interfaces
- Map controls optimized for smaller screens
- Progressive loading to optimize performance

---

# üíæ Data Management

- Initially using Jekyll collections and front matter
- **Insights Content Categories** - Four standardized article types:
  1. **Brand Spotlight** - In-depth profiles of noteworthy brands
  2. **Founder's Journey** - Personal stories behind the brands
  3. **Market Momentum** - Achievements, milestones, and expansion moments
  4. **Location Intelligence** - Geographical insights and regional context
- Market-sector structured data in `_data/market_sectors/{lang}/{market}.yml`
- Future integration with Airtable using a flat table structure
- JSON for complex data (timelines, products, secondary locations)
- CSV import/export for efficient data management
- Sector-specific fields for specialized information

---

# ‚úÖ Implementation Priorities

1. Enhanced search and filter interface
2. Visual taxonomy representation in brand cards
3. MapLibre integration for geographic discovery
4. Two-tier content approach (100+ listings, 2-3 profiles per sector)
5. Multilingual support from day one

---

# ü§ñ AI Onboarding Prompt (use at start of session)

Paste this in Claude or ChatGPT when starting a session:

> This is a Jekyll-based multilingual site (Brandmine) that showcases brands from BRICS+ countries using a four-dimension taxonomy system (sectors, markets, attributes, signals). It features a two-tier content approach with basic listings (100+ per sector) and feature profiles (2-3 per sector). The site uses MapLibre for geographic visualization and has a mobile-first design philosophy. All content exists in three languages (EN/RU/ZH) with consistent URL structures. The design uses BEM naming conventions and CSS custom properties for styling.

# üß† Claude Dimension Awareness and Discovery Instruction

This site relies on a **structured dimension system** across four distinct types:

- `sectors` ‚Äî Industry categories (e.g., natural-beauty, wine, hotels-resorts)
- `attributes` ‚Äî Brand qualities (e.g., founder-led, heritage-brand, artisanal-excellence)
- `signals` ‚Äî Growth potential indicators (e.g., export-ready, franchise-ready, rapid-growth)
- `markets` ‚Äî Regional focus (e.g., russia, brazil, india, china)

Dimensions are defined as individual Markdown files in `_dimensions/{lang}/{type}/`, and referenced in brand front matter using the correct slug.

## Discovery Logic

- The **Discovery section** is driven by these dimension types.
- Do **not create new dimension types**. Always use the four approved ones.
- Dimension filtering occurs on `/brands`, and dimension exploration happens via `/discover`.
- Dimension clouds, related brand logic, and dimension-specific pages all derive from this model.

## Insights Categories

Insights articles must use one of the standardized content categories:

1. **Brand Spotlight**: In-depth profiles of noteworthy BRICS+ brands gaining international momentum.
2. **Founder's Journey**: Personal stories behind the brands and the visionaries who created them.
3. **Market Momentum**: Notable achievements, milestones, and expansion moments for emerging BRICS+ brands.
4. **Location Intelligence**: Geographical insights and regional context that shape brand development and opportunities.

Each category has defined metadata including recommended length, reading time, and content guidelines (stored in `_data/insights/{lang}.yml`).

Claude must align any navigation, filtering, or dimension-related output with this architecture.

---

# ü§ñ Your Responses (Reminder)

1. Provide one file at a time, starting with the most foundational or requested item.
2. Wait for my approval or "next" command before continuing with the next file or section.
3. If writing markdown, wrap the file name and content in fenced code blocks (e.g. ```md or ```yaml) and avoid commentary between them.
4. For multi-step tasks, give a preview plan before beginning (e.g., "I'll generate 3 files: X, Y, Z ‚Äî shall I start with X?")

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not attempt to return more than one document or major block of code in a single response unless I've asked for it explicitly. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

# üìã Coding Tasks & Workflow

## Recommended Steps When Adding New Content or Features

1. **Check Existing Structure**: Look at similar files or components before creating new ones.
2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: 
   - Files: `kebab-case.html`, `kebab-case.css`, etc.
   - Variables: camelCase for JavaScript, kebab-case for CSS
   - Classes: BEM format `.block__element--modifier`
   
3. **Test in All Languages**: Any new feature should be compatible with all three languages (EN, RU, ZH).
4. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile view first, then enhance for larger screens.
5. **Component Reuse**: Look for opportunities to reuse existing components.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Brand
1. Create brand markdown file in each language folder (`_brands/en/`, `_brands/ru/`, `_brands/zh/`)
2. Ensure the brand references existing dimensions
3. Process brand images with `./_scripts/process_brand_images.sh brandname`
4. Add attributions for images in `_data/image_attributions.yml`

### Brand Templates

Three template options are available for creating brand profiles:

1. **Core Template** (`_templates/brands/brand-core.md`): 
   - Absolute minimum required fields
   - Use for rapid initial data entry
   - Contains only essential identification and basic categorization
   - Typically completed in under 5 minutes

2. **Lite Template** (`_templates/brands/brand-lite.md`): 
   - Basic profile with essential sections
   - Use when moderate information is available
   - Contains founder details, basic timeline, and key attributes
   - Good for non-featured brands that need more than basic listing

3. **Full Template** (`_templates/brands/brand-full.md`): 
   - Comprehensive profile with all possible fields
   - Use for featured brands or when extensive information is available
   - Includes complete taxonomy, social media, certifications, timeline, etc.
   - Supports rich storytelling and detailed brand information

Always process brand images after creation using:
```bash
./_scripts/process_brand_images.sh brand-slug

### Adding a New Dimension
1. Create dimension files in appropriate category subfolder for all languages
2. Update any relevant translation files in `_data/`
3. Ensure the dimension matches the established taxonomy

### Updating Styles
1. Identify the appropriate CSS file by component or page
2. Follow BEM naming conventions
3. Use CSS custom properties from tokens
4. Test responsive behavior on multiple screen sizes


## Brand Templates

Two template options are available for creating brand profiles:

1. **Full Template** (`_brands/brand-en.md`): 
   - Complete template with all possible fields and sections
   - Use when comprehensive brand information is available
   - Includes all taxonomy connections, social media, timeline, certifications, etc.

2. **Lite Template** (`_brands/brand-lite.md`):
   - Simplified template with only essential fields
   - Use for quick brand creation with minimal information
   - Contains only core identification, basic categorization, and minimal content
   - Can be progressively enhanced later

Always process brand images after creation using:
```bash
./_scripts/process_brand_images.sh brand-slug
