  Component: pages/founders/content.html

  Purpose: Renders the main content/introduction from the page's markdown body.
           This component displays any written content between the front matter
           and end of the markdown file, typically containing page introductions,
           descriptions, or explanatory text.

  Context:
  - Used within the founders layout's logic-light architecture
  - Positioned as the first section when included in page.sections array
  - Provides a flexible way to add page-specific content without modifying includes

  Parameters:
  - None (uses the page.content variable)

  Dependencies:
  - CSS: pages/founders/content.scss (if specific styling needed)
  - Relies on {{ content }} from Jekyll's page rendering

  Usage in Front Matter:
  sections:
    - content
    - header
    - ...other sections

  Notes:
  - If no content exists in the markdown file, this section will be empty
  - Useful for SEO and user context before displaying the main interface
