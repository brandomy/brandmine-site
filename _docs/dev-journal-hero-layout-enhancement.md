**Date:** 2025-06-12
**Task:** Hero Layout Vertical Centering Enhancement
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Hero sections using the `journal-hero--landing` component were displaying text content below the image height rather than vertically centered alongside it on tablet/desktop views
- While the responsive grid layout was functioning correctly (mobile stacked, desktop side-by-side), the visual balance was off because text appeared to "drop" below the image instead of being centered within the same vertical space

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified: 
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-types.scss` - Added vertical centering to hero grid layout
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Key choices made during implementation:
  - Used CSS Grid's `align-items: center` property for clean, semantic vertical centering
  - Applied enhancement only to desktop breakpoint (â‰¥768px) to preserve mobile stacking behavior
  - Single-line addition to existing media query for minimal code impact
- Rationale for approach taken:
  - CSS Grid provides the most robust and browser-compatible solution for vertical centering
  - Enhancing existing styles rather than creating new components maintains codebase simplicity
  - Preserves all existing responsive behavior while adding the desired visual improvement
- Alternative approaches considered:
  - Flexbox on individual grid cells - rejected as it would require more extensive changes
  - JavaScript-based height calculation - rejected as CSS-only solution is more performant
  - Absolute positioning - rejected as it would break responsive flow

**Code Changes**
- Modified `.panel--hero-split .journal-hero` grid layout at line 310 in `_panel-types.scss`:
  ```scss
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    align-items: center; /* Ensure both grid cells are vertically centered */
    min-height: var(--hero-height-md);
  }
  ```
- No new components or helpers were needed
- Integration points affected: All pages using `journal-hero--landing` component (About, Journal posts, etc.)
- No new dependencies introduced

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll serve` - Development server for live testing
  - Inspected rendered HTML/CSS in browser DevTools
- What worked as expected:
  - Text content now vertically centers alongside 3:2 aspect ratio images on desktop
  - Mobile stacking behavior remains unchanged
  - Cross-language consistency verified (EN/RU/ZH pages)
  - No CSS compilation errors
  - Visual balance significantly improved on tablet/desktop viewports
- No issues discovered during testing

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Consider adding CSS custom property for vertical alignment to make it configurable per page
  - Could extend vertical centering option to other hero variants if needed
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Audit other hero component variants to ensure consistent vertical alignment behavior
  - Document the vertical centering behavior in component documentation
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Simple CSS addition with no complex dependencies makes this enhancement very maintainable
  - Future hero layout modifications should preserve the `align-items: center` property
  - Consider adding visual regression tests for hero layouts to catch any future regressions
