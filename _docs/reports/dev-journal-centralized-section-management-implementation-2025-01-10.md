**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Task:** Centralized Page Section Management Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brandmine had 85+ files with scattered custom `sections:` arrays in front matter, creating maintenance overhead and inconsistencies across languages
- Page section management was fragmented across individual files rather than centralized, violating the "Logic Light" architecture principle
- Updates to page structures required editing multiple files across three languages (EN/RU/ZH), increasing error risk and development time
- No clear guidelines existed for when custom sections were appropriate vs. when centralized defaults should be used

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 6 documentation files, 4 new layout type definitions
- Files modified: 84 content files cleaned of custom sections, 1 central configuration file enhanced
- Files moved/deleted: 1 legacy file archived (`dimensions.json` â†’ `_data/_archive/legacy-dimensions/`)

**Technical Decisions**
- **Centralized Configuration**: All page section management consolidated into `_data/page_sections.yml` following data-driven architecture
- **Three-Tier Priority System**: Maintained flexibility with page front matter > include parameters > centralized defaults
- **Pattern-Based Defaults**: Updated defaults to match actual usage patterns rather than theoretical structures
- **Legitimate Override Documentation**: Established clear criteria for when custom sections are appropriate (A/B testing, special campaigns, content-specific needs)
- **Layout Specialization**: Created category-specific layouts (`attributes-category`, `markets-category`, `sectors-category`, `signals-category`) to handle dimension discovery variations

**Code Changes**
- **New layout types created**: 4 specialized dimension category layouts in `_data/page_sections.yml`
- **Central configuration enhanced**: Updated 6 existing layout defaults to match actual usage patterns
- **Integration points preserved**: All existing `_includes/pages/` structure maintained, no breaking changes to component architecture
- **Dependencies maintained**: All panel mappings, translations, and include relationships preserved

**Testing Results**
- **Commands run**: 
  ```bash
  grep -r "sections:" pages/ _brands/ _founders/ _insights/ _posts/
  bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
  ```
- **What worked as expected**: 84 files successfully transitioned to centralized configuration without layout breaks
- **Issues discovered**: 
  - 2 collection pages (EN insights/founders) were missed in initial cleanup but subsequently fixed
  - Legacy sidebar comments required removal from 10 insight files
  - Section order mismatch in blog posts required defaults correction (author-profile placement)

**Future Considerations**
- **Potential improvements**: 
  - Consider creating actual Jekyll layout files for dimension categories rather than just section definitions
  - Monitor remaining 25 legitimate custom sections for consolidation opportunities
  - Quarterly review process for pattern detection and default optimization
- **Related tasks needed**:
  - Create missing include files for new dimension category sections if layouts are implemented
  - Develop content creator training materials emphasizing centralized approach
  - Consider automation for detecting when new patterns emerge across multiple files
- **Maintenance considerations**:
  - Established clear documentation in CLAUDE.md and dedicated guide for future developers
  - Template files updated to prevent regression to anti-patterns
  - Monitoring system needed to prevent proliferation of unnecessary custom sections

**Architecture Achievements**
- **Centralization Rate**: 77% of all pages now use centralized configuration (84 out of ~109 total)
- **Maintenance Reduction**: 77% fewer files requiring individual section management
- **Language Consistency**: Perfect alignment achieved across EN/RU/ZH versions
- **"Logic Light" Compliance**: Successfully implemented data-driven configuration over template logic

**File Impact Summary**
- **Phase 1**: Updated 6 layout defaults, prepared infrastructure
- **Phase 2**: Cleaned 44 files (home pages, brand profiles, founder profiles, insight articles)
- **Phase 3**: Refined defaults, cleaned 12 additional files (collection pages, journal pages)
- **Phase 4**: Updated documentation and templates to prevent regression
- **Final Cleanup**: Addressed remaining inconsistencies, cleaned 28 additional files

**Business Value Delivered**
- **Single source of truth** for page structure management
- **Faster content creation** - no need to copy section configurations
- **Reduced development errors** - consistent behavior across languages
- **Improved maintainability** - page structure changes require single file update
- **Enhanced developer experience** - clear guidelines and centralized control
