# Development Journal Entry

**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Task:** Multilingual Journal Image Migration  
**Status:** Completed

## Problem Statement

- Journal images were using permalink-based directory organization (e.g., `2025-05-23-maplibre-journey/`) which broke multilingual support when switching between languages
- Image paths contained language-specific suffixes (`-ru`, `-zh`) causing broken images when users switched languages
- The system needed migration from filename-based to ref-based organization for consistent multilingual image handling
- Featured article images on journal landing pages were still using old permalink-based paths

## Implementation Summary

- **Files created:** 1 (`_includes/helpers/journal-image.html`)
- **Files modified:** 3 core components, 3 multilingual post files
- **Files moved/deleted:** Removed 3 old permalink-based image directories

## Technical Decisions

- **Ref-based organization**: Chose to use the `ref` field from post front matter instead of filename for image directory naming
- **Helper component approach**: Created a dedicated journal-image helper to encapsulate ref-based logic rather than modifying collection-image directly
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained fallback to filename-based paths in entry-card component for posts without ref fields
- **Centralized image logic**: Used existing collection-image component as the foundation to maintain responsive image behavior

## Code Changes

### New components/helpers created:
- `_includes/helpers/journal-image.html` - Ref-based image helper with automatic alt text generation and collection-image integration

### Integration points modified:
- `_includes/pages/journal/hero.html` - Updated to use journal-image helper instead of direct collection-image calls
- `_includes/components/cards/entry-card.html` - Modified to prioritize `item.ref` over filename-based paths
- `_includes/pages/journal/featured-article.html` - Fixed to use `featured_post.ref` for image path construction

### Dependencies or relationships affected:
- All journal post markdown files now rely on `ref` field for correct image display
- Image directory structure simplified to ref-based naming only
- Color scheme consistency enforced across multilingual versions

## Testing Results

### Commands run:
- `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Server restart
- Cross-language navigation testing

### What worked as expected:
- Images load correctly in all three languages (EN/RU/ZH)
- Language switcher maintains image display without broken links
- Entry cards on journal landing pages use correct ref-based paths
- Featured article images display properly across all language versions
- Color scheme consistency achieved (all versions now use blue background)

### Issues discovered and resolved:
- Russian and Chinese versions of MapLibre post were missing `color_scheme: blue` field - added to maintain visual consistency
- Featured article component was still using filename-based paths - updated to use ref field

## Future Considerations

### Potential improvements:
- Consider automated validation script to ensure all multilingual posts have matching ref fields
- Add ref field validation to existing language consistency checker script
- Implement automated color scheme consistency checks across multilingual post versions

### Related tasks that might be needed:
- Update documentation to emphasize importance of ref field in multilingual posts
- Create template for new journal posts that includes ref field by default
- Consider migrating other collection types (insights, brands) to similar ref-based image organization

### Maintenance considerations:
- All new journal posts must include ref field for proper image display
- Image processing scripts should use ref-based directory naming
- Regular audits needed to ensure multilingual post consistency (ref, color_scheme, sections)
- Monitor for any remaining permalink-based image references in other components
