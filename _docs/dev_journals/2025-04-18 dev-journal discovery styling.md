# Development Journal: Discovery Dimension Styling System
Date: 2025-04-18

## Problem Statement
We needed to establish a comprehensive, consistent styling system for our four discovery dimensions (sectors, attributes, signals, markets) in the Brandmine platform. Each dimension needed its own visual identity while maintaining consistency with our overall design system. The existing pages used inconsistent class names and styling approaches, which made maintenance difficult and risked visual inconsistency across languages.

## Approach
1. Analyzed the existing structure of each discovery dimension page
2. Identified common patterns and components across all dimensions
3. Created dedicated CSS files for each dimension, following BEM methodology
4. Updated HTML templates to use dimension-specific class names
5. Applied consistent color coding across all dimensions
6. Ensured all dimensions work in all three languages (EN, RU, ZH)

## Implementation Details

### CSS Architecture
We created four dedicated CSS files, one for each discovery dimension:
- `discover-sectors.css`: Using olive/green color scheme
- `discover-attributes.css`: Using secondary/orange color scheme
- `discover-signals.css`: Using accent/purple color scheme
- `discover-markets.css`: Using sky/blue color scheme

Each file follows the same structure:
```css
/* Hero panel enhancement */
.dimension__title {
  color: var(--dimension-200);
}

/* Section styles */
.dimension__section { ... }
.dimension__section-header { ... }
.dimension__section-title { ... }
.dimension__section-description { ... }

/* Grid layouts */
.dimension__grid { ... }
.dimension__item { ... }

/* Featured items */
.dimension__featured { ... }
.dimension__featured-item { ... }

/* Navigation */
.dimension__navigation { ... }
.dimension__navigation-link { ... }
```

### Color Coding System
We established a consistent color-coding system across all dimensions:
- **Sectors**: Olive/green (`var(--olive-*)`) - represents industries and categories
- **Attributes**: Orange/secondary (`var(--secondary-*)`) - represents brand qualities
- **Signals**: Purple/accent (`var(--accent-*)`) - represents growth indicators
- **Markets**: Blue/sky (`var(--sky-*)`) - represents geographic regions

For each dimension, we use the corresponding color for:
- Icons and icon backgrounds
- Border accents on cards
- Background colors for navigation links
- Category headers

### HTML Template Structure
We standardized the HTML structure across all dimension pages:
1. Hero panel with title and subtitle
2. Main content panels with section headers
3. Grid displays of items
4. Featured section with highlighted content
5. Insights section with related articles
6. Cross-dimension navigation footer

Example pattern:
```html
<!-- Hero Panel -->
<div class="panel panel--hero">
  <div class="panel__content">
    <h1 class="panel__heading-primary dimension__title">{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="panel__subtitle">{{ page.subtitle }}</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Content Sections -->
<div class="panel panel--light">
  <div class="panel__content">
    <section class="dimension__section">
      <div class="dimension__section-header">
        <h2 class="dimension__section-title">
          <span class="dimension__icon dimension__icon--all">
            <!-- Icon SVG -->
          </span>
          Section Title
        </h2>
        <p class="dimension__section-description">Description text</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Content grid or featured items -->
    </section>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Special Components
We implemented several dimension-specific components:
- **Markets**: Map visualization with legend
- **Signals**: Premium feature banner
- **Attributes**: Category grouping with specialized tag display
- **Sectors**: Russian sectors focus section

## Decisions Made

1. **BEM Naming Convention**: We chose to use consistent BEM-style class names (`dimension__element--modifier`) to maintain clarity and prevent conflicts.

2. **Custom CSS Files vs. Shared**: We decided on separate CSS files for each dimension rather than a single shared file. This approach allows for easier maintenance and clearer organization, though it means some duplication. The benefits of separation outweighed the minor repetition.

3. **Color Scheme Selection**: We carefully selected color variables from our design tokens that maintain sufficient contrast while visually distinguishing the dimensions. The colors needed to work well against white backgrounds and as border accents.

4. **Multilingual Support**: We ensured all templates support all three languages (EN, RU, ZH) with consistent styling. This required testing with different text lengths and character sets.

5. **Panel Structure**: We maintained the existing panel structure as the base layout system but enhanced it with dimension-specific styling, keeping the system consistent with the rest of the site.

## Resources

1. **CSS Files**:
   - `discover-sectors.css`
   - `discover-attributes.css`
   - `discover-signals.css`
   - `discover-markets.css`

2. **Template Files**:
   - English, Russian, and Chinese versions of:
     - `sectors.md`
     - `attributes.md`
     - `signals.md`
     - `markets.md`

3. **Design Tokens**:
   - Used existing color variables from `tokens.css`
   - Added new panel type: `panel--sky-soft` for Markets

## Insights & Learning

1. **Consistent Structure is Key**: Having a consistent HTML structure across all dimensions made styling much more manageable and allows for global changes in the future.

2. **Color as Information**: The color-coding system provides subtle but important visual cues to users about which taxonomy dimension they're exploring. This improves information architecture without requiring explicit labeling.

3. **BEM Naming Prevention**: Using dimension-specific prefixes (e.g., `markets__` vs `sectors__`) prevents accidental style conflicts when updating one dimension.

4. **Responsive Considerations**: Each dimension required specific responsive adjustments, particularly for the Markets map and the Signals premium banner.

5. **Multilingual Challenges**: Chinese text often takes up less horizontal space but has different height requirements. Russian text typically runs longer than English. These differences required careful testing in all languages.

## Next Actions

1. **Apply to Other Pages**: Extend this styling system to other dimension-specific pages, such as individual sector, attribute, signal, and market pages.

2. **Create Documentation**: Document the styling system for future developers and ensure clear guidance on when to use which dimension styles.

3. **Implement JavaScript Integration**: Complete the Map implementation for markets that integrates with this styling system.

4. **Optimize Performance**: Review CSS file sizes and consider strategies to reduce duplication without sacrificing clarity.

5. **Add Animations**: Consider adding subtle animations or transitions that are consistent across dimensions while reinforcing the color-coding system.

6. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on whether the color-coding system effectively communicates the different dimensions to users.

The discovery dimension styling system now provides a solid foundation for a consistent, maintainable, and visually coherent user experience across all taxonomy dimensions in our platform.
