# Development Journal: Insight Cards Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-12  
**Developer:** Claude Code (Claude Anthropic)  
**Task:** Implement responsive image handling in insight cards and create tagged variation

## Overview

This journal documents the implementation of responsive image handling for insight cards and the creation of a tagged insight card variation that displays dimension tags (market, sector, attribute, signal) to provide additional context at a glance.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Responsive Image Handling:** Fixed an issue where insight card images weren't loading correctly because they were referencing direct image paths instead of using the responsive image pattern with 400w, 800w, and 1200w suffixes.

2. **Image Path Mismatches:** Fixed mismatches between the hero_image paths specified in insight frontmatter and the actual image filenames in the directory structure.

3. **Enhanced Context:** Created a new "tagged" variation of insight cards that displays dimension tags to provide users with additional context about the content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Insight Category Icons

Created SVG icons for the four insight types:
- Brand Spotlight - Star with package icon
- Founder's Journey - Person with journey path and milestones
- Market Momentum - Growth chart with upward trending line
- Location Intelligence - Map pin with geographic indicators

These icons provide visual cues to quickly identify the type of content. Implemented a reusable `insight-icon.html` component that can display the appropriate icon based on the category ID.

### 2. Responsive Image Handling

Updated all three insight card components to use proper responsive image code:

```liquid
{% assign base_path = include.insight.hero_image | split: "." %}
{% assign base_name = base_path[0] %}
{% assign extension = base_path[1] | default: "jpg" %}

<img src="{{ base_name | relative_url }}-400w.{{ extension }}"
     srcset="{{ base_name | relative_url }}-400w.{{ extension }} 400w,
             {{ base_name | relative_url }}-800w.{{ extension }} 800w,
             {{ base_name | relative_url }}-1200w.{{ extension }} 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"
     alt="{{ include.insight.title }}"
     loading="lazy">
```

The key aspects of this implementation:
- Parses the base name and extension from the hero_image path
- Builds a proper srcset with multiple resolution options (400w, 800w, 1200w)
- Uses the relative_url filter in the correct position
- Adds lazy loading for better performance
- Sets appropriate sizes attribute for responsive behavior

### 2. Fixed Image Path Mismatches

Updated the hero_image paths in insight frontmatter to match the actual filenames:

| Insight | Original Filename | Correct Filename |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| ru-siberian-honey-corridor | hero-altai-forest.jpg | hero-siberian-honey.jpg |
| ru-teatime-founder-journey | hero-teatime-production.jpg | hero-teatime.jpg |

These changes were made consistently across all language versions (EN, RU, ZH) to ensure proper rendering.

### 3. Tagged Insight Card Variation with Category Icons

Created a new variation of the insight card that displays dimension tags to provide more context about the content at a glance.

**New Components:**
- `_includes/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.html` - Card template with dimension tags and category icons
- `_includes/components/icons/insights/*.svg` - SVG icons for each insight category
- `_includes/components/icons/insight-icon.html` - Reusable component for displaying insight icons
- `assets/css/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.scss` - Styling for tagged cards
- `_includes/pages/home/latest-insights-tagged.html` - Section using tagged cards

**Testing Pages:**
- `/en/dev/insight-cards-test/` - Comparison of different card variations
- `/en/dev/home-tagged-insights/` - Home page with tagged insights section

**CSS Implementation:**
The tagged variation uses Brandmine's dimension color coding system:
- Sectors: Mint green/olive
- Markets: Light blue
- Attributes: Light orange/secondary
- Signals: Light purple/accent

This maintains consistency with the brand's visual taxonomy system while providing valuable context about the content's relevance.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Tags are designed to be compact and responsive
   - Card layout adjusts gracefully on smaller screens
   - Text truncation ensures tag readability at all sizes

2. **Standardized Structure:**
   - Maintains consistent BEM naming conventions
   - Follows existing card component patterns
   - Reuses existing taxonomy color coding

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Follows the site's component organization structure
   - Uses the manifest system for CSS imports
   - Properly documented with comments

## Testing

The implementation was tested by building the site and verifying:
- All images load correctly with their responsive variants
- Dimension tags display properly and match the taxonomy system
- Layout works correctly on different screen sizes

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. Add the ability to filter insights by dimension tags
2. Consider implementing tag hover states for additional information
3. Create a configuration option to easily switch between card variations site-wide
4. Extend the tagged approach to other card types (brand cards, sector cards)

## Conclusion

The implementation of responsive images and tagged variations enhances both the performance and usability of insight cards. The responsive image handling ensures optimal image loading based on device size, while the dimension tags provide valuable context that helps users quickly identify relevant content based on market, sector, attributes, and signals.

These enhancements maintain Brandmine's established design language while adding functionality that aligns with the site's mission of multi-dimensional brand discovery.
