**Date:** 2025-06-03
**Task:** CSS Specificity Resolution - Eliminating !important Declarations
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- 58 `!important` declarations creating maintenance issues
- Specificity wars between component variations

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: `_docs/css-specificity-guidelines.md`
- Files modified: 10 SCSS files, 3 HTML includes
- Result: Reduced !important usage from 58 to 6 (90% reduction)

**Technical Decisions**
- Used BEM modifiers (`panel--contained`, `founder-card--recent`)
- Applied `:is()` pseudo-class for grouped selectors
- Passed variant parameters through includes
- Kept 6 justified !important uses (accessibility, third-party, JS)

**Code Changes**
- Panel system: Added `panel--contained` modifier
- Founder cards: Created `founder-card--recent` variant
- Forms: Removed legacy styles
- Components: Used compound selectors for proper specificity

**Testing Results**
- All visual styling preserved
- No regressions found
- Clean CSS architecture achieved

**Future Considerations**
- Add lint rules to prevent new !important
- Consider CSS Layers when browser support improves
- Review inline styles that might need attention
