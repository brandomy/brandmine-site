**Date:** 2025-06-02
**Task:** Impact Panel Implementation - Complete Standardization
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Impact sections were missing from section arrays in `_data/page_sections.yml`, preventing them from rendering on Primary Navigation pages
- Founders page had inconsistent section naming (using 'header' instead of 'hero') causing configuration misalignment
- Impact section includes used inconsistent translation patterns (mix of direct data access and translation helper)
- Journal page lacked impact section implementation entirely
- Translation content was missing for journal impact statements across all languages

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_includes/pages/journal/impact.html` - New journal impact section using standardized pattern
- Files modified:
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Added impact sections to all primary navigation pages, fixed founders page section naming
  - `_includes/pages/brands/impact.html` - Standardized to use translation helper pattern
  - `_includes/pages/founders/impact.html` - Standardized to use translation helper pattern  
  - `_includes/pages/insights/impact.html` - Standardized to use translation helper pattern
  - `_includes/pages/discovery/impact.html` - Simplified translation helper implementation
  - `_data/translations/en.yml` - Added journal impact content
  - `_data/translations/ru.yml` - Added journal impact content
  - `_data/translations/zh.yml` - Added journal impact content
  - `pages/en/journal.md` - Added impact section to sections array
  - `pages/ru/journal.md` - Added impact section to sections array
  - `pages/zh/journal.md` - Added impact section to sections array
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Standardized all impact sections to use centralized translation helper pattern for consistency with "Logic Light" architecture
- Used capture blocks with empty fallbacks to prevent rendering when translation content is missing
- Added impact sections positioned after hero and before content sections for optimal strategic messaging flow
- Fixed founders page to use 'hero' section naming instead of 'header' for consistency with other navigation pages
- Implemented panel--primary with panel--impact modifier for proper teal background styling

**Code Changes**
- Updated `_data/page_sections.yml` to include impact sections for all primary navigation pages:
  ```yaml
  brands, founders, discovery, insights, journal:
    default_sections:
      - hero
      - impact  # ‚Üê Added
      - content
  ```
- Standardized impact section pattern across all pages:
  ```liquid
  {% assign current_lang = page.lang | default: 'en' %}
  {% capture t_title %}{% include helpers/t.html key="{page}.impact.title" fallback="" lang=current_lang %}{% endcapture %}
  {% capture t_text %}{% include helpers/t.html key="{page}.impact.text" fallback="" lang=current_lang %}{% endcapture %}
  {% if t_title != "" %}
    <h2 class="panel__heading-secondary">{{ t_title }}</h2>
  {% endif %}
  {% if t_text != "" %}
    <p class="panel__lead-text">{{ t_text }}</p>
  {% endif %}
  ```
- Added journal impact translations in all three languages with appropriate messaging for "building in public" theme

**Testing Results**
- Built Jekyll site successfully with `bundle exec jekyll build` - no errors
- Verified all primary navigation pages now have impact sections in configuration
- Confirmed translation helper pattern works consistently across all impact sections
- Tested panel--primary background styling maintains teal appearance for impact sections
- All multilingual impact content renders properly across EN/RU/ZH languages

**Future Considerations**
- Monitor impact section positioning and messaging effectiveness across different page types
- Consider adding visual enhancements to impact sections (icons, stats, etc.) if needed
- Ensure new pages follow the standardized impact section pattern
- Review impact content periodically for messaging consistency and effectiveness
- Document the impact section pattern in component documentation for future reference
