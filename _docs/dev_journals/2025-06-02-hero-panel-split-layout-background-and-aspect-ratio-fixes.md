**Date:** 2025-06-02
**Task:** Hero Panel Split Layout Background and Aspect Ratio Fixes
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Primary Navigation pages (Brands, Discovery, Journal, Founders, Insights, About) were using the correct split layout structure (text left, image right) but missing the teal radial gradient background across the entire panel area
- The `.panel--hero-split` was incorrectly set to `background: transparent` instead of matching the teal gradient used in regular `.panel--hero`
- About page hero images were displaying in square format instead of the intended 3:2 aspect ratio, causing image cropping issues on desktop/tablet screens

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified: 
  - `/assets/css/layout/panels.scss` - Fixed panel background and image aspect ratio
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Changed `.panel--hero-split` background from `transparent` to use the same teal radial gradient as `.panel--hero` for visual consistency across the four-tier hero system
- Applied `aspect-ratio: 3/2` to all screen sizes for `.journal-hero__image` containers instead of mobile-only to maintain consistent image proportions
- Maintained existing `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: center` to ensure proper image display without distortion

**Code Changes**
- Updated `.panel--hero-split` background property:
  ```scss
  // Before
  background: transparent;
  
  // After  
  background: radial-gradient(circle at center, var(--primary-400) 0%, var(--primary-600) 100%);
  ```
- Modified `.journal-hero__image` aspect ratio handling:
  ```scss
  // Before
  @media (max-width: 767px) {
    aspect-ratio: 3/2;
  }
  
  // After
  aspect-ratio: 3/2; /* Maintain 3:2 aspect ratio on all screen sizes */
  ```

**Testing Results**
- Rebuilt Jekyll site with `bundle exec jekyll build` to compile CSS changes
- Started development server with `bundle exec jekyll serve` for live testing
- Verified teal radial gradient background now appears across entire panel area on all Primary Navigation pages
- Confirmed About page hero image now displays in proper 3:2 rectangular format instead of square cropping
- All split layout pages (Brands, Discovery, Journal, Founders, Insights, About) now have consistent visual presentation

**Future Considerations**
- Monitor browser caching issues when deploying CSS changes to production
- Consider adding explicit height constraints if image containers need more predictable sizing behavior
- Evaluate if other page types using split layouts need similar aspect ratio consistency
- Document the four-tier hero system specifications to prevent similar background/styling inconsistencies
