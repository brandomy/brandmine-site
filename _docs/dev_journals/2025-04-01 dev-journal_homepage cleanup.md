# Development Journal: Discovery Panel Tabs Implementation
**Date:** April 1, 2025

## 1. Problem Statement
The discovery panel tabs on the Brandmine homepage were not functioning properly. Users were unable to see a visual change when clicking on the tabs (Markets, Business Sectors, Brand Attributes, Growth Signals). The JavaScript event handlers were being triggered correctly (as shown in console logs), but the visual state change wasn't obvious to users.

## 2. Approach
After investigating the issue through console logs and debugging, we determined that:
- The existing tab implementation had conflicting CSS between different files
- The JavaScript was working correctly but the visual changes weren't apparent
- There were nested DOM content loaded events causing potential issues

Rather than trying to fix the existing implementation, we decided to create a completely fresh implementation with:
- Clean HTML structure with clear namespacing
- Dedicated CSS with no conflicts
- Minimal JavaScript with straightforward logic
- Complete isolation from other components

## 3. Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Discovery2 Panel - Clean Implementation -->
<div class="panel panel--discovery2">
  <div class="panel__content">
    <h2 class="panel__heading-secondary">Explore by Discovery Path</h2>
    
    <!-- Tab Navigation -->
    <div class="discovery2-tabs">
      <div class="discovery2-nav">
        <button class="discovery2-tab" data-tab="markets">Markets</button>
        <button class="discovery2-tab active" data-tab="sectors">Business Sectors</button>
        <button class="discovery2-tab" data-tab="attributes">Brand Attributes</button>
        <button class="discovery2-tab" data-tab="signals">Growth Signals</button>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Tab Content -->
      <div class="discovery2-content">
        <!-- Individual tab panes with IDs matching data-tab attributes -->
        <div class="discovery2-pane" id="markets-pane">
          <p class="discovery2-intro">Explore brands by their country of origin within the BRICS+ markets.</p>
          <div class="discovery2-tags">
            <!-- Market tags -->
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Additional tab panes for sectors, attributes, and signals -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Highlights
```css
/* Panel styling */
.panel--discovery2 {
  background-color: var(--secondary-50);
  border-top: 4px solid var(--primary-400);
  border-bottom: 4px solid var(--primary-400);
}

/* Tab container - 80% width as requested */
.discovery2-tabs {
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
}

/* Tab navigation */
.discovery2-nav {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--primary-200);
}

/* Tab panes */
.discovery2-pane {
  display: none;
}

.discovery2-pane.active {
  display: block;
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Discovery2 Panel Tab Functionality
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const tabs = document.querySelectorAll('.discovery2-tab');
  const panes = document.querySelectorAll('.discovery2-pane');
  
  tabs.forEach(tab => {
    tab.addEventListener('click', function() {
      // Get the tab's data-tab attribute
      const tabId = this.getAttribute('data-tab');
      const targetPane = document.getElementById(tabId + '-pane');
      
      // Deactivate all tabs and panes
      tabs.forEach(t => t.classList.remove('active'));
      panes.forEach(p => p.classList.remove('active'));
      
      // Activate the clicked tab and its corresponding pane
      this.classList.add('active');
      if (targetPane) {
        targetPane.classList.add('active');
      }
    });
  });
});
```

## 4. Decisions Made
1. **Clean Slate Approach**: Rather than trying to debug the existing implementation, we chose to create a completely fresh component with new class names to avoid any conflicts.

2. **Clear Visual Indicators**: Added stronger visual indicators for active tabs through background color, font weight, and a colored border.

3. **Namespace Isolation**: Used `discovery2-` prefix for all classes to avoid conflicts with existing CSS.

4. **Simplified JavaScript**: Removed unnecessary animations and complexities, focusing on the core tab switching functionality.

5. **BEM Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with the site's BEM structure by using appropriate panel classes.

## 5. Resources
- **HTML**: Complete Discovery2 panel HTML implementation
- **CSS**: Dedicated styling for the Discovery2 panel
- **JavaScript**: Simple tab switching logic
- **Integration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for adding the component to the site

## 6. Insights & Learning
1. **Isolation is powerful**: Creating a completely isolated component avoided the complexity of debugging CSS conflicts.

2. **Consistent naming matters**: Using clear, consistent naming conventions makes code more maintainable.

3. **Visual feedback is crucial**: Even when JavaScript is working correctly, users need clear visual feedback to understand that actions have had an effect.

4. **Simplicity wins**: A simple, focused implementation is often more robust than a complex one.

5. **Console debugging helps**: The console logs revealed that the JavaScript was actually working, which helped narrow down the issue to visual styling.

## 7. Next Actions
1. Apply the same clean implementation approach to other problematic interactive components.

2. Consider adding keyboard navigation to the discovery tabs for accessibility.

3. Add a hover effect to the tags to improve interactive feedback.

4. Document the new component in the site's style guide for future reference.

5. Consider further visual enhancements to make the selected tab's content area more distinctive.
