# Development Journal: Brandmine Site Strategy Update
Date: 2025-04-10

## Problem Statement
We needed to review and refine the Brandmine site strategy to ensure all components work together cohesively. After working on the project for a month, our concept has evolved, and we needed to document the current thinking to guide further development. Specifically, we needed to clarify how the brand-related components integrate on the Home Page and Brands page, and establish priorities for completing the site setup.

## Approach
1. Analyzed existing code components and documentation
2. Identified relationships between components
3. Reviewed updated brand template structure from the morning's work
4. Created detailed technical implementation plans for key components
5. Documented priorities and next steps
6. Created an updated comprehensive site strategy

## Implementation Details

### Core Brand-Related Components
We identified the key components that make up the brand system:

1. **Brand Templates & Data Structure**
   - `brand-en.md` (Template): Defines the structured data format for brand profiles
   - Includes enhanced fields for founder info, location data, and timelines
   
2. **Layouts**
   - `brand.html`: Layout for individual brand profile pages
   - `brands.html`: Layout for the brands listing page with filters

3. **Components**
   - `brand-card.html`: Reusable component for displaying brand summaries
   - `brand-image.html`: Component for responsive brand imagery
   - `search-filter.html`: Enhanced filtering interface
   - `map-component.html`: Geographical visualization

4. **Content Pages**
   - `brands.md`: Content for the brands listing page
   - `index.html`: Home page with featured brands section

### Integration Strategy
We created detailed implementation plans for:

1. **Enhanced Search & Filter Component**
   - Multi-dimensional filtering across all taxonomy dimensions
   - Visual representation of active filters
   - Mobile-responsive design

2. **Brand Card Enhancements**
   - Visual taxonomy representation with color coding
   - Clear presentation of signals
   - Consistent styling aligned with design tokens

3. **MapLibre Integration**
   - Cluster-based visualization of brand locations
   - Integration with taxonomy filtering
   - Mobile-optimized controls

4. **Brands Page Implementation**
   - Google-style search with filtering system
   - Grid and list view options
   - Progressive loading for performance

### Data Architecture
We defined the Airtable structure to support:
- Two-tier approach (100+ listings with 2-3 profiles per sector)
- Multilingual content (EN/RU/ZH)
- Comprehensive taxonomy system
- Rich brand metadata

## Decisions Made

1. **Focus on Russian Wine Brands**
   - Initial dataset will focus on 100+ Russian wine brands
   - Will serve as proof of concept for the illumination strategy

2. **Maintain Four-Dimension Taxonomy**
   - Keep sectors, markets, attributes, and signals as core taxonomy
   - Use visual differentiation (color coding) for clarity
   - Sectors -> mint green/olive
   - Markets -> light blue
   - Attributes -> light orange
   - Signals -> light purple/accent

3. **Two-Tier Content Approach**
   - Tier 1: 100+ basic listings per sector
   - Tier 2: 2-3 feature profiles per sector
   - Balance quantity with quality for efficiency

4. **Technical Implementation Priorities**
   - Enhanced search filter component
   - Brand card visual enhancements
   - JavaScript filtering functionality
   - MapLibre integration
   - Airtable structure setup

5. **Maintained Importance of Founder Stories**
   - Continued emphasis on human narratives
   - Focus on generational transitions
   - Visual storytelling through quality imagery

## Resources

1. **Technical Implementation Plans**
   - Enhanced Search & Filter Component
   - Brand Card Component Enhancement
   - MapLibre Integration
   - Brands Page Implementation

2. **Airtable Fields Structure**
   - Comprehensive field definitions
   - Table relationships
   - Multilingual support implementation

3. **Strategic Implementation Plan**
   - Phased approach with clear priorities
   - Content strategy guidelines
   - Success metrics and KPIs

## Insights & Learning

1. **Mobile-First Is Essential**
   - Reaffirmed that many Russian and Chinese clients primarily use mobile devices
   - All components must be designed for mobile first, then enhanced for desktop

2. **Color Usage Needs Refinement**
   - Current implementation has too much color
   - Need to be more strategic with color application
   - Use color primarily to differentiate taxonomy dimensions

3. **Visual Hierarchy Is Critical**
   - Need clear visual priorities in brand cards and profiles
   - Use typography, spacing, and color intentionally to guide attention

4. **Taxonomy-Driven Discovery Is a Differentiator**
   - The four-dimension taxonomy system is a key strength
   - Allows multiple entry points to discovery
   - Creates a more nuanced understanding than typical directories

5. **Maps Add Unique Value**
   - Location intelligence is a critical component
   - No competitors appear to offer geographic visualization
   - Adds a dimension to storytelling (regional connections, clusters)

## Next Actions

1. **Complete Technical Foundation**
   - Implement enhanced search filter component
   - Update brand card visualization
   - Set up MapLibre integration
   - Develop JavaScript filtering functionality

2. **Content Preparation**
   - Set up Airtable structure
   - Begin importing wine brand dataset
   - Create 2-3 featured wine brand profiles
   - Implement taxonomy tagging

3. **Additional Pages**
   - Review and fix what's broken on the Discovery page
   - Set up the Insights page structure
   - Ensure multilingual support across all pages

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image optimization workflow
   - Add progressive loading for brand listings
   - Optimize map performance for mobile

5. **Launch Preparation**
   - Set up analytics tracking
   - Create content generation workflow
   - Establish quality control process
   - Define post-launch measurement strategy

This update has provided a clear roadmap for completing the Brandmine MVP while maintaining focus on the core value proposition of illuminating previously hidden brand opportunities through a combination of structured discovery, rich storytelling, and geographic visualization.
