# Development Journal: Search Implementation
Date: 2025-04-20

## Problem Statement
We needed to implement a search functionality for the Brandmine site that works with our multilingual structure (EN, RU, ZH) and integrates with our 404 error page to improve user experience when content isn't found. The search needed to match our site's design system and clearly indicate different content types (brands, insights, etc.) in the results.

## Approach
1. Created a search.json file to generate a searchable index of site content
2. Developed search result pages for each language
3. Implemented robust error handling in the search JavaScript
4. Added type indicators with appropriate styling for different content types
5. Integrated a simplified search box on the 404 error page to help users find content
6. Added appropriate translations for all search-related text

## Implementation Details

### Search Index Generation
We implemented a simple search.json file that initially indexes brand content:

```liquid
---
layout: null
---
[
  {% for brand in site.brands %}
    {% if brand.title and brand.lang %}
    {
      "title": {{ brand.title | jsonify }},
      "url": {{ brand.url | relative_url | jsonify }},
      "lang": {{ brand.lang | jsonify }},
      "type": "brand"
    }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
]
```

This approach provides a foundation that can be extended later to include insights, pages, and tags.

### Search Page Implementation
We created search pages for each language (EN, RU, ZH) with consistent structure but localized text:

```html
<div class="panel panel--light">
  <div class="panel__content">
    <h1 class="panel__heading-primary">Search Results</h1>
    
    {% include simple-search.html %}
    
    <div id="search-results" class="search-results">
      <p class="search-results__loading">Loading search results...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Search Logic
We implemented robust JavaScript that:
1. Parses search parameters from the URL
2. Fetches and validates the search.json data
3. Filters results by language and query
4. Displays results with appropriate styling
5. Handles errors gracefully

The search results display includes:
- Type badges with color-coding
- Result titles with links
- Content excerpts for context

### 404 Page Integration
We added a search box to the 404 error page to help users find content when they encounter a missing page:

```html
<div class="error-page__search">
  <p class="error-page__search-text">{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].errors.try_search }}</p>
  {% include simple-search.html %}
</div>
```

This was implemented across all three language versions of the 404 page.

### Type Badge Styling
We implemented CSS for type badges that visually differentiates content types:

```css
/* Type-specific styling */
.search-results__type-badge {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 2px 8px;
  margin-bottom: 4px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  font-size: var(--text-xs);
  font-weight: var(--font-bold);
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.search-results__item--brand .search-results__type-badge {
  background-color: var(--olive-100);
  color: var(--olive-800);
}

.search-results__item--insight .search-results__type-badge {
  background-color: var(--secondary-100);
  color: var(--secondary-800);
}
```

## Decisions Made

1. **JSON Structure**
   - Started with brands only for the MVP, with a structure that can be expanded
   - Used the `jsonify` filter for proper escaping of content
   - Added `type` field to identify content categories

2. **Language Handling**
   - Created separate search pages for each language
   - Filtered results by language to ensure relevant content
   - Added type translation to display localized content type names

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented robust error handling for JSON parsing
   - Added debug logging to help diagnose issues
   - Added clear error messaging for users

4. **UI Design**
   - Used type badges consistent with our visual taxonomy
   - Maintained BEM naming conventions for CSS
   - Ensured responsive design for mobile compatibility

5. **Feature Scope**
   - Prioritized core functionality and correct styling for the MVP
   - Noted issues with multilingual URLs to be addressed in future iterations

## Resources

1. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - search.json - Search index generator
   - /en/search.md, /ru/search.md, /zh/search.md - Search result pages
   - search-results.css - Styling for search results
   - simple-search.html - Simplified search box include
   - 404.md files for each language - Updated with search functionality

2. **Translations Added**:
   - Added search-related translations to all language files (en.yml, ru.yml, zh.yml)
   - Added translations for content type labels in each language

## Insights & Learning

1. **JSON Generation in Jekyll**
   - Jekyll's Liquid templating can generate valid JSON, but requires careful escaping
   - The `jsonify` filter is essential for handling special characters and UTF-8

2. **JavaScript Error Handling**
   - Fetching text before parsing JSON allows for better debugging
   - Logging raw JSON helps diagnose syntax errors

3. **Multilingual Considerations**
   - Non-Latin character sets require special attention for URL encoding
   - Type translation needs to be handled in JavaScript, not CSS classes

4. **Jekyll Search Limitations**
   - Client-side searching works well for small to medium sites
   - As content grows, a more robust search solution may be needed

5. **Design System Integration**
   - Consistent use of design tokens ensures visual coherence
   - BEM methodology made it easier to add new components

## Next Actions

1. **Short Term**
   - Complete the 404 page integration across all languages
   - Test search functionality with more content to ensure reliability
   - Monitor performance as brand count increases

2. **Medium Term**
   - Expand search.json to include insights, pages, and tags
   - Fix URL encoding issues with multilingual content
   - Improve search result ranking based on relevance

3. **Long Term**
   - Consider implementing a more robust search solution (Algolia, Lunr.js)
   - Add faceted search capabilities
   - Add search analytics to track common search terms

4. **Known Issues**
   - Search result links for non-Latin languages (Russian, Chinese) may need URL encoding fixes
   - Search doesn't yet include all content types
   - Performance may degrade as content volume increases

The search implementation provides a valuable user experience enhancement for the MVP, with a clear path for future improvements as the site evolves.
