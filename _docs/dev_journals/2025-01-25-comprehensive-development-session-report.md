## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### 1. Search & Filter System Fixes

**Problems Identified:**
- Empty JSON data files showing Jekyll template syntax instead of actual data
- Missing clear buttons and non-functional filter combinations
- Single-column filter layout reducing usability
- Missing sectors and attributes in search checkboxes
- Unwanted breadcrumbs appearing on 404 pages
- Unsorted country dropdown in search filters

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### JSON Data Generation Fix
- **Files Modified:** `/assets/data/brands.json`, `/assets/data/founders.json`, `/assets/data/insights.json`
- **Issue:** Templates contained `{{ site.brands | jsonify }}` instead of generated content
- **Solution:** Enhanced Jekyll templates to generate comprehensive JSON with:
  - Complete brand data (sectors, markets, attributes, signals, location, founding year)
  - Founder profiles with generation info, positions, cross-border experience
  - Insights with categories, reading time, dates, taxonomy tags

#### Search Filter JavaScript Enhancement
- **File:** `/assets/js/search-filter.js`
- **Improvements:**
  - Fixed `updateFilterCount()` method for proper active filter counting
  - Enhanced `displayResults()` with proper grid/list view rendering
  - Added `setupViewToggle()` and `setupLoadMore()` methods
  - Fixed `clearAllFilters()` to properly reset UI state
  - Implemented debounced search for better performance

#### Multi-Column Filter Layout
- **File:** `/assets/css/components/search/search-filter.scss`
- **Implementation:**
```scss
.filter-groups {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: var(--space-6);
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

#### Breadcrumbs Component Fix
- **File:** `/_includes/components/ui/breadcrumbs.html`
- **Solution:** Added conditional logic to prevent breadcrumbs on 404 pages:
```liquid
{% unless page.ref == 'error-404' or page.title == 'Page Not Found' or page.url contains '404' %}
```

#### Complete Dimensions Display
- **File:** `/_includes/components/search/search-filter.html`
- **Fix:** Removed `limit: 8` restriction, now showing all 16 sectors
- **Data Consistency:** Fixed halal-foods filename inconsistency across languages

#### Sorted Country Dropdown
- **Implementation:** Dynamic country loading with alphabetical sorting using countries.json data
- **Enhancement:** Multilingual country names based on current language context

## 🏗️ Forms Component Architecture Overhaul

### 2. "Logic Light" Forms Restructuring

**Objective:** Implement modular forms architecture where CSS structure mirrors includes organization

**Before:** Monolithic `forms.scss` file (239 lines)  
**After:** 8 modular component files + organized structure

#### New Forms Structure Created:
```
assets/css/components/forms/
├── _index.scss              # Central import file
├── form.scss                # Base form styles and containers
├── input-field.scss         # Text, email, password, search, tel inputs
├── textarea-field.scss      # Multi-line text areas with variants
├── select-field.scss        # Dropdown selectors with custom styling
├── contact-form.scss        # Tally embedded contact forms
├── newsletter-form.scss     # MailerLite newsletter forms
├── feedback-form.scss       # User feedback with rating system
├── validation.scss          # Form validation states and messages
├── custom-contact-form.scss # Custom contact form alternative
└── custom-newsletter.scss   # Custom newsletter alternative
```

#### Benefits Achieved:
- **Maintainability:** Each component can be modified independently
- **Performance:** Only necessary styles loaded per page
- **Consistency:** CSS structure mirrors includes organization
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new form components
