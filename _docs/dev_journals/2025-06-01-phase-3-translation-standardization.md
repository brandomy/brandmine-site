**Task:** Phase 3: Translation Standardization - "Logic Light" Architecture Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- The codebase had inconsistent translation patterns with multiple approaches: direct `site.data.translations[lang]` lookups, `{% assign t = site.data.translations[...] %}` assignments, and the newer `helpers/t.html` helper system
- Mixed translation patterns made the codebase harder to maintain and debug
- Legacy translation assignments violated the "Logic Light" architecture principle by embedding complex logic in templates
- Inconsistent fallback handling could lead to blank content when translations were missing
- Critical bug where `dimensions-grid.html` was incorrectly using translation files for dimension data instead of proper JSON data files

**Implementation Summary**
- Files modified: 39+ include files across brand, founder, dimension, and insight directories
- Translation patterns converted: ~100+ individual `site.data.translations` patterns to standardized `helpers/t.html` usage
- Legacy assignment patterns removed: All `{% assign t = site.data.translations[...] %}` patterns eliminated from target directories
- Data source correction: Fixed dimension data sourcing in `dimensions-grid.html`

**Technical Decisions**
- **Centralized Translation Helper**: Standardized on `{% include helpers/t.html key="..." fallback="..." lang=... %}` pattern for all translation needs
- **Namespace Convention**: Established clear key namespacing (`brand.*`, `founder.*`, `dimensions.*`, `insights.*`, `buttons.*`, etc.)
- **Language Parameter Consistency**: Used appropriate language context (`lang=brand.lang`, `lang=founder.lang`, `lang=dimension.lang`, `lang=page.lang`)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Implemented meaningful fallback text for every translation call to prevent blank content
- **Priority-Based Conversion**: Converted files with highest pattern counts first to maximize impact

**Code Changes**
- **Brand Includes (9 files)**: Converted all brand profile sections including `business-intelligence.html`, `identity.html`, `founder-narrative.html`, and page sections
- **Founder Includes (6 files)**: Converted founder profile sections including `associated-brands.html` (8 patterns), `professional-details.html` (6 patterns)
- **Dimension Includes (13 files)**: Converted all dimension discovery components including `all-brands.html` (10 patterns), plus navigation and filter components
- **Insight Includes (7 files)**: Converted insight article components including `header.html`, section files, and sharing components
- **High-Priority Components (7 files)**: Converted core layout and component files including `layout/footer.html`, `layout/header.html`, `components/ui/breadcrumbs.html`
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Corrected `dimensions-grid.html` to use proper JSON data sources (`site.data.sectors.sectors`, `site.data.markets.markets`) instead of translation files

**Testing Results**
- **Pattern Count Verification**: Reduced `site.data.translations` patterns in target directories from ~280+ to ~221 remaining (primarily in non-target directories)
- **File-by-File Conversion**: Verified successful conversion of all high-priority files using grep pattern counting
- **Data Source Validation**: Confirmed dimension grid now uses correct JSON data sources for dimension content
- **Namespace Consistency**: Verified all converted files use appropriate key namespacing and language parameters

**Future Considerations**
- **Remaining Directories**: Consider extending standardization to other directories like `_includes/pages/home/`, `_includes/pages/about/`, etc.
- **Translation Key Validation**: Implement automated checking to ensure all translation keys exist in translation files
- **Build Testing**: Run full Jekyll build to verify no translation-related errors introduced
- **Language Testing**: Test all three languages (EN/RU/ZH) to ensure proper translation fallback behavior
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor if increased helper includes impact build performance (likely minimal)
- **Documentation Updates**: Update component documentation to reflect new translation patterns
- **Automated Migration**: Consider creating script to automate future translation pattern conversions

**Related Work**
- This completes Phase 3 of the "Logic Light" architecture refactoring
- Builds on previous work establishing the `helpers/t.html` translation system
- Supports the overall goal of maintaining simple, data-driven templates with minimal embedded logic
- Improves maintainability for the multilingual (EN/RU/ZH) Brandmine site
