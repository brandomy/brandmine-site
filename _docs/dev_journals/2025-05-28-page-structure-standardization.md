# Development Journal: Page Structure Standardization Across All Languages
**Date:** May 28, 2025  
**Session Type:** Continuation from previous context-limited session  
**Focus:** Complete standardization of topline pages (Brands, Founders, Discovery, Insights)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Complete the standardization of all major pages across EN/RU/ZH languages to follow identical structural patterns, eliminating sidebar architectures in favor of linear layouts with consistent impact sections.

## 🔧 Technical Context

**Architecture Pattern:** Logic-light, layout-driven content management  
**Page Structure Target:** breadcrumbs → hero → impact → content → [page-specific] → contact-cta  
**Languages Affected:** English (EN), Russian (RU), Chinese (ZH)  
**Pages Standardized:** 12 total (4 page types × 3 languages)

## 🚨 Critical Issue Resolution

### YAML Parsing Error Fix
**Problem:** Missing document start marker in translations file causing build failures
```yaml
# BEFORE (broken)
en:
  brands:
    impact:

# AFTER (fixed)
---
en:
  brands:
    impact:
```

**Impact:** This single character fix (`---`) resolved all subsequent YAML parsing issues and enabled the standardization work to proceed.

## 📊 Translation System Enhancement

### New Impact Section Content
Added standardized impact statements for all four page types:

**Brands Impact:**
- Title: "Discover BRICS+ Brands Ready for Global Markets"
- Focus: Unprecedented access to consumer brands with growth potential

**Founders Impact:**
- Title: "Meet the Visionaries Behind BRICS+ Innovation" 
- Focus: Cultural bridge-building and business vision

**Discovery Impact:**
- Title: "Navigate the BRICS+ Brand Universe"
- Focus: Four-dimensional taxonomy system explanation

**Insights Impact:**
- Title: "Intelligence That Drives BRICS+ Brand Discovery"
- Focus: Research depth and strategic intelligence

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

### Impact Section Template
Created unified impact section includes for all pages:

```html
{% assign t = site.data.translations[page.lang].[page-type].impact %}
<div class="content-section">
  <div class="content-section__content">
    {% if t.title %}
      <h2 class="content-section__title">{{ t.title }}</h2>
    {% endif %}
    {% if t.text %}
      <p class="content-section__text">{{ t.text }}</p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if include.content and include.content != empty %}
      <div class="content-section__markdown">{{ include.content }}</div>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Files Created:**
- `_includes/pages/brands/impact.html`
- `_includes/pages/founders/impact.html` 
- `_includes/pages/discovery/impact.html`
- `_includes/pages/insights/impact.html`

## 📄 Page Structure Transformation

### English Pages (EN) - Updated
✅ **Standardized sections arrays:**
```yaml
sections:
  - breadcrumbs
  - hero
  - impact          # NEW: Added before content
  - content
  - [page-specific sections]
  - contact-cta
```

### Russian Pages (RU) - Complete Restructure
**Major Discovery:** RU pages had hardcoded HTML panels instead of layout-driven structure

**Before (problematic):**
```html
<!-- Hardcoded panels with inline HTML -->
<div class="panel panel--hero">
  <div class="panel__content">
    <!-- Static HTML content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**After (standardized):**
```yaml
layout: brands
sections:
  - breadcrumbs
  - hero
  - impact
  - content
  - filter-interface
  - featured-brands
  - recent-brands
  - contact-cta
```

### Chinese Pages (ZH) - Structure Alignment
✅ **Converted from mixed HTML/Markdown to pure layout-driven approach**
✅ **Preserved all Chinese content while standardizing structure**
✅ **Removed hardcoded search forms and panels**
