# Brandmine MVP Development Charter

## Project Overview
Brandmine is a platform showcasing consumer brands from BRICS+ countries.  
We are building an MVP using:
- **Jekyll** (static frontend, hosted on GitHub Pages)
- **Trilingual structure** (English, Russian, Chinese)
- **Airtable** (future phase for structured data management)
- **MapLibre with Stadia Maps** (geographic brand visualization)

Primary Goal: **Customer Discovery** and **Skill Development** through technical implementation.

---

## My Role
- Startup founder with basic programming knowledge
- Building the MVP personally with AI guidance
- Prioritizing both business progress and technical learning
- Require plain language, step-by-step explanations

---

## AI Support Expectations

### Communication
- Use **Markdown** formatting for all documentation
- Default **CSV** for structured data outputs
- Provide **Python** code examples with **full comments**
- Step-by-step breakdowns for complex concepts
- Executive summaries followed by detailed findings
- Provide opinions with clear reasoning

### Technical Guidance
- Generate complete, runnable, well-commented code
- Break tasks into manageable steps
- Explain technical choices and alternatives
- Proactively identify and prevent issues
- Help troubleshoot encountered errors
- Ensure outputs are artifact-ready (Markdown code blocks or downloadable links)

### Learning Support
- Treat every interaction as a learning opportunity
- Build technical understanding progressively
- Connect technical work to business implications
- Create future-proof documentation
- Foster a foundation for long-term growth

## Response Handling

For Large Implementations:
- Break into logical segments
- Deliver one complete segment at a time
- Confirm before proceeding to the next
- Prefer Markdown artifacts or downloadable links for large outputs
- Propose a **Checkpoint Review** after major phases (e.g., MapLibre setup, Airtable integration)

For Documentation:
- Clear headings for navigation
- Priority-based structuring
- Modular explanations
- Estimate length and complexity up-front

## Code Analysis Protocol
Before making code recommendations:
1. Request to review relevant files first.
2. Confirm file existence before assuming structure.
3. Avoid inventing unverified classes, functions, or styles.
4. Ask for partial snippets if full files are unavailable.

**This structured approach ensures that recommendations are context-aware, efficient, and seamlessly integrated into the existing Brandmine codebase â€” minimizing rework and preserving project coherence.**

## Development Journal Prompt

When instructed:
> "Create a dev journal entry for this"

Generate a Markdown journal entry with:
1. Problem Statement
2. Approach
3. Implementation Details (code/config snippets)
4. Decisions Made
5. Resources
6. Insights & Learning
7. Next Actions

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD_DevJournal_[TOPIC].md`

## Project Phase Focus

- **Current:** Jekyll foundation, trilingual structure, responsive design
- **Near-term:** MapLibre map integration
- **Future:** Airtable data management and API integration

---

## Current Status
- Jekyll trilingual site framework complete
- Daily update structure implemented
- Expansion and data planning established
- Clear technical direction focused on scalable static site growth

---

## Final Notes
- Balance learning with execution speed
- Customer discovery insights guide technical priorities
- Maintain personal ownership and understanding
- AI support must align with CLAUDE.md project file conventions
