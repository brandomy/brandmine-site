# Development Journal: Multilingual Testimonial Image Implementation
Date: 2025-04-19

## Problem Statement
After successfully implementing our new image processing system and responsive image includes, we needed to update the testimonial sections on the homepage. The initial implementation only covered the English version, but we needed to ensure consistency across all three languages (English, Russian, and Chinese). Additionally, we needed to leverage our existing translation data to properly localize image alt text.

## Approach
1. Analyzed the existing testimonial sections in the homepage templates for all three languages
2. Identified placeholder images that needed to be replaced
3. Implemented consistent image includes across all language versions
4. Utilized translation variables for alt text to ensure proper localization
5. Ensured proper CSS styling for the testimonial images
6. Confirmed that image sizing was appropriate for all devices

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated English Version (`/en/index.html`)
The English version was updated first to use the proper image includes with translation variables:

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include brand-image.html 
     brand="dragonfly" 
     image="color" 
     purpose="logo"
     ext="png"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.dragonfly_retreats }} logo"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

and

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include site-image.html 
     category="people"
     image="georgie-yam" 
     purpose="profile"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.georgie_yam }} founder photo"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

### 2. Updated Russian Version (`/ru/index.html`)
The Russian version was updated to use the same structure with localized descriptive text:

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include brand-image.html 
     brand="dragonfly" 
     image="color" 
     purpose="logo" 
     ext="png"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.dragonfly_retreats }} логотип"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

and

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include site-image.html 
     category="people"
     image="georgie-yam" 
     purpose="profile"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.georgie_yam }} фото"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

### 3. Updated Chinese Version (`/zh/index.html`)
The Chinese version followed the same pattern:

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include brand-image.html 
     brand="dragonfly" 
     image="color" 
     purpose="logo" 
     ext="png"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.dragonfly_retreats }} 标志"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

and

```html
<div class="testimonial-card__author-image">
  {% include site-image.html 
     category="people"
     image="georgie-yam" 
     purpose="profile"
     alt="{{ site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials.georgie_yam }} 肖像"
     class="testimonial-card__author-img" %}
</div>
```

### 4. CSS Styling
We also increased the size of the testimonial images for better visibility:

```css
.testimonial-card__author-image {
  width: 80px;  /* Increased from 48px */
  height: 80px; /* Increased from 48px */
  border-radius: 50%;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-right: var(--space-3);
  border: 2px solid var(--primary-100);
}

.testimonial-card__author-image img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

## Decisions Made

1. **Consistent Structure Across Languages**
   - We used the same HTML structure and include patterns across all three language versions
   - This ensures consistent rendering and maintenance efficiency

2. **Translation Variable Usage**
   - We leveraged the existing `site.data.translations[page.lang].testimonials` data for company and person names
   - This allows centralized management of translations in one place

3. **Localized Descriptive Text**
   - While we used translation variables for names, we localized the descriptive portion of the alt text
   - "logo" in English, "логотип" in Russian, "标志" in Chinese
   - This ensures proper localization of accessibility features

4. **Explicit Class Assignment**
   - Added a specific class (`testimonial-card__author-img`) to the images within the includes
   - This provides more explicit styling control

5. **Increased Image Size**
   - Increased the testimonial image container from 48px to 80px
   - This makes the logos and profile photos more visible without breaking the layout

## Resources

1. **Translation Data**
   - English, Russian, and Chinese translations in `_data/translations/`:
   ```yaml
   # English
   testimonials:
     georgie_yam: "Georgie Yam"
     dragonfly_retreats: "Dragonfly Therapeutic Retreats"

   # Russian
   testimonials:
     georgie_yam: "Джорджи Ям"
     dragonfly_retreats: "Драгонфлай Терапевтик Ретритс"

   # Chinese
   testimonials:
     georgie_yam: "任佐治"
     dragonfly_retreats: "上海悠庭保健俱乐部"
   ```

2. **Image Files**
   - Brand logo: `/assets/images/brands/dragonfly/dragonfly-logo-color-400w.png` (and other sizes)
   - Profile photo: `/assets/images/people/people-profile-georgie-yam-400w.jpg` (and other sizes)

## Insights & Learning

1. **Multilingual Consistency**
   - Maintaining consistent structure while allowing for language-specific text is essential
   - Using translation variables makes maintenance easier and reduces the risk of inconsistencies

2. **Translation Variable Strategy**
   - It's more maintainable to store translated proper names in translation files rather than hardcoding them
   - This allows for centralized updates if names change or new languages are added

3. **Image Alt Text Localization**
   - Alt text should be fully localized, not just the names but also the descriptive elements
   - This improves accessibility for non-English speakers using screen readers

4. **CSS Structure for Multilingual Sites**
   - The CSS structure should be language-agnostic where possible
   - Styling based on structural classes rather than content allows for consistent rendering across languages

5. **Explicit vs. Implicit Styling**
   - While CSS can target elements implicitly (e.g., `.testimonial-card__author-image img`), explicit classes provide clearer intent
   - This is especially important in a system that will be maintained by multiple developers

## Next Actions

1. **Test Multilingual Rendering**
   - Verify that testimonial images display correctly in all three languages
   - Test both desktop and mobile views

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the styleguide to reflect the new testimonial image implementation
   - Document the pattern for other developers to follow

3. **Consider Automated Testing**
   - Implement visual regression testing to catch any future CSS issues affecting testimonials
   - Ensure testimonial sections maintain consistency across language versions

4. **Optimize Image Loading**
   - Consider implementing lazy loading for testimonial images below the fold
   - Measure impact on page load performance

5. **Create a Maintenance Plan**
   - Establish process for adding new testimonials across all language versions
   - Document the workflow for updating existing testimonials

The multilingual testimonial image implementation demonstrates how our image processing system and includes can be applied consistently across different language versions while maintaining proper localization. This approach will serve as a model for other multilingual components throughout the site.
