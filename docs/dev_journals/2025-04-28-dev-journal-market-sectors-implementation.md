# Development Journal: Market Sectors Implementation
Date: 2025-04-28

## Problem Statement
We needed to develop a scalable approach for managing market-specific sector information across our multilingual site that would work with our existing dimension/tag taxonomy structure. Our initial content focused heavily on Russian market sectors, but we needed a system that could support expansion to other BRICS+ markets while maintaining consistency with our information architecture.

## Approach
1. Analyzed existing content in `russian-sectors.md` which contained detailed information on 16 Russian sectors
2. Considered multiple implementation options:
   - Collections approach (creating a new Jekyll collection)
   - Front matter variables (enhancing existing tags)
   - Data files approach (storing structured information in YAML)
3. Selected the data files approach as the most suitable for MVP stage due to lower technical complexity and incremental implementation path
4. Designed a structured YAML format for market-specific sector data
5. Extracted content from the `russian-sectors.md` file and reformatted it into the new structure
6. Created necessary templates and includes to display the information
7. Added a comprehensive set of fields to better represent sector information

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
We created a structured YAML format in `_data/market_sectors/en/russia.yml` with the following organization:

```yaml
# Basic structure
sector-slug:
  title: "Market Sector Title"
  description: "Brief description of the sector in this market"
  popularity_rank: 1
  established_year: 1995
  image: "/path/to/image.jpg"
  key_stats:
    - label: "Statistic Name"
      value: "Statistic Value"
      icon: "icon-name"
  # Additional structured data...
  full_content: |
    Complete markdown content...
```

Each sector entry includes:
- Basic identification (title, description)
- Metadata (popularity_rank, established_year)
- Visual assets (image path)
- Structured data (key_stats, highlights, regions, opportunities)
- Market-specific data (export_markets, certification_types)
- Positioning information (luxury_tier, price_range)
- Complete content (full markdown text)

### Templates and Integration
We created several key templates:

1. `market-sector-highlight.html` - Include for displaying market-specific sector highlights
2. `market-sector.html` - Layout for full market-sector detail pages

We integrated these with the existing site by:
- Adding code to `dimension.html` layout to show market-specific highlights on sector pages
- Adding code to show sector highlights on market pages
- Creating individual market-sector pages for each combination

### CSS Implementation
Created a new CSS file in `assets/css/collections/markets/market-sector.css` and integrated it into our CSS manifest system:

```css
/* assets/css/manifest/collections.css */
/* ... existing imports ... */
@import '../collections/markets/market-sector.css';
```

## Decisions Made

1. **Data Files vs Collections Approach**
   - Chose data files for their simplicity and minimal changes to existing structure
   - Data-driven approach provides clear separation of content and presentation
   - Easier to iterate and expand incrementally as we add more markets

2. **Enhanced Field Structure**
   - Added new fields to provide richer context:
     - `popularity_rank`: For sorting sectors by importance
     - `established_year`: Historical context on sector development
     - `export_markets`: International trade information
     - `certification_types`: Quality and authenticity standards
     - `comparable_sectors`: Cross-market reference points

3. **Alphabetical Organization**
   - Organized sectors alphabetically in YAML for easier maintenance
   - This replaced our previous categorization (lifestyle vs food)
   - Added clear documentation comments at the file top to explain structure

4. **Content Structure Standardization**
   - Created consistent patterns for descriptions, key stats, and full content
   - Established guidelines for writing market-sector content with examples
   - Developed image naming conventions and requirements

5. **CSS Placement**
   - Placed styles under the collections category, mirroring our organization of other content types
   - This keeps the CSS structure aligned with our content organization

## Resources

1. **Data File**
   - Comprehensive `_data/market_sectors/en/russia.yml` file with all 16 sectors
   - Detailed documentation comments at the file top

2. **Template Files**
   - `_includes/market-sector-highlight.html` for displaying highlights
   - `_layouts/market-sector.html` for full-page display

3. **Individual Page Templates**
   - 16 market-sector page templates with consistent front matter

4. **Documentation**
   - Implementation checklist for verifying correct setup
   - Comprehensive reference guide for content creation and maintenance

## Insights & Learning

1. **Data Organization Matters**
   - Structured approach to market-sector data creates multiple ways to use the same content
   - Separating content from presentation enables more flexible display options

2. **Content Reusability**
   - The same market-sector data can now be shown on sector pages, market pages, and dedicated combination pages
   - This creates a richer user experience without content duplication

3. **Scalability Considerations**
   - The approach scales well from our MVP Russian focus to future BRICS+ markets
   - Consistent structure makes adding new markets straightforward

4. **Documentation Importance**
   - Creating detailed implementation docs and content guidelines is critical for maintaining consistency
   - The reference guide will be valuable for both current implementation and future expansion

5. **Taxonomy Enhancement**
   - This approach enhances our existing taxonomy rather than replacing it
   - Preserves the benefits of our dimension system while adding market-specific depth

## Next Actions

1. **Implementation**
   - Complete integration with dimension.html layout
   - Create individual market-sector pages for all Russian sectors
   - Add required translations to language files
   - Create market-sector images in the correct format and location

2. **Testing**
   - Verify market-specific content appears correctly on sector pages
   - Test individual market-sector pages for proper display
   - Confirm mobile responsiveness of all components

3. **Content Enhancement**
   - Consider additional fields for specific sector types
   - Enhance content for priority sectors first
   - Begin planning content for Chinese market sectors

4. **Future Development**
   - Develop cross-market comparison functionality
   - Create visualization tools for market-sector data
   - Consider API endpoints for this structured data
