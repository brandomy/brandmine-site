# Development Journal: CSS Grid Styleguide Implementation

## Date: March 25, 2025

## Problem Statement
We needed to fix the Brandmine styleguide navigation that was broken due to issues with CSS Grid implementation. Specifically, we needed to implement a responsive navigation system that worked properly across all screen sizes, while also fixing display issues with components like color swatches and hero panels.

## Approach
We took a systematic, test-driven approach to diagnose and fix the issues:

1. **Isolated testing**: Created simple test files to verify CSS Grid functionality in Jekyll/GitHub Pages
2. **Debugging**: Added debug tools to track responsive behavior and navigation state
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Built a solution that started with basic functionality and added features incrementally 
4. **Language-specific structure**: Adapted our approach to work with our multilingual site structure
5. **Component-specific fixes**: Addressed issues with color swatches and hero panels separately

## Implementation Details

### Grid-Based Layout System
```css
/* Core container layout */
.styleguide-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
      "navigation content";
  grid-template-columns: var(--sidebar-width, 250px) 1fr;
  /* Mobile first adjustments for smaller screens */
  @media (max-width: 992px) {
    grid-template-areas: "content";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

/* Navigation placement */
.styleguide-nav {
  grid-area: navigation;
  /* Desktop: standard grid placement */
  /* Mobile: fixed position with transform for off-canvas */
  @media (max-width: 992px) {
    position: fixed;
    transform: translateX(-100%);
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  }
}

/* Content area */
.styleguide-content {
  grid-area: content;
}
```

### Component Fixes

#### Color Swatches
We created a color swatch include and added proper display styles:
```html
<!-- Color swatch include -->
<div class="color-swatch">
  <div class="color-sample {{ include.color }}" style="background-color: {{ include.hex }};"></div>
  <div class="color-details">
    <div class="color-name">{{ include.name }}</div>
    <div class="color-values">
      <span class="color-hex">{{ include.hex }}</span>
      <span class="color-rgb">RGB: {{ include.rgb }}</span>
    </div>
    <div class="color-usage">{{ include.usage }}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Code Block Visibility
Fixed code blocks that were showing black text on dark backgrounds:
```css
.example-code {
  padding: var(--space-4);
  background-color: var(--neutral-900, #111827); /* Dark background */
  border-top: 1px solid var(--neutral-200, #E5E7EB);
  overflow-x: auto;
}

.example-code code {
  font-family: var(--font-mono, monospace);
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  color: white; /* Ensure code is visible on dark background */
}
```

## Decisions Made

1. **Mobile-first design**: Implemented a responsive design that starts with mobile layout and enhances for larger screens
2. **Systematic file structure**: Organized files with clear separation of concerns
   - Layouts in `_layouts/`
   - CSS components in `assets/css/components/`
   - JavaScript in `assets/js/`
3. **Used CSS Grid over flexbox**: Chose CSS Grid for the main layout due to its two-dimensional layout capabilities
4. **Testing approach**: Created isolated test files before implementing full solution
5. **Translation strategy**: Used language-specific directories and front matter to maintain multilingual structure

## Resources Created

1. Styleguide layout: `_layouts/styleguide.html`
2. CSS files:
   - `assets/css/styleguide.css`
   - `assets/css/components/hero-panels.css`
3. JavaScript: `assets/js/styleguide.js`
4. Color swatch include: `_includes/styleguide/color-swatch.html`
5. Test files (for diagnostic purposes, can be deleted)

## Insights & Learning

1. **CSS Grid responsive behavior**: 
   - CSS Grid areas can completely reorganize at different breakpoints
   - Fixed positioning can be combined with Grid for mobile off-canvas navigation

2. **Jekyll multilingual constraints**:
   - Jekyll files need language-specific permalink structure
   - Content must be organized in language directories
   - Front matter must include correct language specifications

3. **CSS specificity challenges**:
   - Override issues can be tricky to diagnose
   - Example panels need specific styles to not interfere with demonstration components

4. **Testing methodology**:
   - Isolated tests provide clarity when diagnosing complex issues
   - Progressive enhancement works well for navigation systems

5. **HTML entity encoding**:
   - Code examples require HTML entity encoding (`&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`)
   - This prevents example code from being executed as actual HTML

## Next Actions

1. **Style variation fixes**: Implement fixes for hero panel variations not showing distinct colors
2. **Review remaining components**: Check other styleguide components for similar issues
3. **Add copy functionality**: Implement a "copy code" button for code examples
4. **Documentation**: Create documentation for the styleguide system
5. **Performance optimization**: Optimize CSS and JS for production

## Unresolved Issues

1. **Hero panel color variations**: The hero panels are all showing the same color despite having different variant classes
2. **Component variant testing**: Need a comprehensive review of all component variants
3. **Cross-browser testing**: Need to test in multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior
