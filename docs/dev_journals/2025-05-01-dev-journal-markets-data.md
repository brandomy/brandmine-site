# Development Journal: BRICS+ Markets Data Enhancement
**Date:** 2025-05-01  
**Topic:** Enhancing market data structure for BRICS+ countries

## 1. Problem Statement

Our existing market data in `_data/markets/en.yml` lacked sufficient depth and structure to support our mission of connecting BRICS+ brands with international partners. The data had minimal information with many empty fields (`long_description`, `hero_image`). We needed a comprehensive, multilingual data structure that would provide context for both brand owners and potential partners while supporting our Jekyll site's discovery features.

## 2. Approach

1. Identified key data fields relevant to our mission of illuminating BRICS+ brands
2. Created a structured YAML format with consistent fields across all markets
3. Developed comprehensive English content for all 10 BRICS+ markets
4. Translated content into Russian and Chinese while maintaining consistent structure
5. Organized data to support both brand storytelling and practical business information

## 3. Implementation Details

### Key Data Structure
```yaml
- id: country-id
  icon: country-id
  country_code: xx
  short_description: Brief overview
  long_description: |
    Multi-paragraph rich description with market context
  hero_image: '/assets/images/markets/country-id.jpg'
  key_export_sectors: [Array of sectors]
  gdp_total: 'Economic data'
  gdp_per_capita: 'Per capita figures'
  growth_rate: 'Percentage'
  population: numeric value
  trademark_registry: 'Registry name and URL'
  registration_timeframe: 'Timeframe for trademark registration'
  trade_alliances: ['Array of trade blocs']
  founder_transition_rate: 'Percentage'
  premium_segment_growth: 'Percentage'
  ecommerce_penetration: 'Percentage'
  key_digital_platforms: ['Array of platforms']
  cultural_brand_factors: [
    'Array of cultural elements impacting brand narratives'
  ]
  success_stories: [
    {name: 'Brand Name', sector: 'Sector', achievement: 'Key achievement'}
  ]
```

### Key Content Focus Areas
- Economic context (GDP, growth rates, population)
- Brand registration practicalities (trademark processes, timeframes)
- Cultural factors influencing brand narratives
- Digital ecosystem penetration and platforms
- Success stories highlighting pathway possibilities
- Trade alliances creating market access opportunities

## 4. Decisions Made

1. **Standardized Structure**: Created a consistent data structure across all 10 markets to enable comparison and maintain design predictability.

2. **Field Selection**: Chose fields that balance practical business information (trademark registries, timeframes) with storytelling elements (cultural factors, success stories).

3. **Multilingual Approach**: Maintained identical data structure across all three languages while adapting cultural references appropriately, rather than just direct translation.

4. **Hero Image Pattern**: Standardized image paths to `/assets/images/markets/[country-id].jpg` for consistent asset management.

5. **Trade Alliance Focus**: Highlighted BRICS membership alongside regional trade blocs to emphasize the connectivity between these markets.

6. **Data Over Description**: Used structured data fields for key metrics (e-commerce penetration, premium segment growth) rather than embedding these in prose descriptions.

## 5. Resources

1. **Data Files Created:**
   - `_data/markets/en.yml` - English market data
   - `_data/markets/ru.yml` - Russian market data
   - `_data/markets/zh.yml` - Chinese market data

2. **Reference Structure:**
   ```yaml
   - id: market-id
     # Basic identification
     icon: market-id
     country_code: xx
     short_description: "Localized description"
     long_description: "Detailed description in appropriate language"
     hero_image: "/assets/images/markets/market-id.jpg"
     
     # Economic & business data
     key_export_sectors: []
     gdp_total: ""
     gdp_per_capita: ""
     growth_rate: ""
     population: 0
     
     # Practical business information
     trademark_registry: ""
     registration_timeframe: ""
     trade_alliances: []
     
     # Market dynamics
     founder_transition_rate: ""
     premium_segment_growth: ""
     ecommerce_penetration: ""
     key_digital_platforms: []
     
     # Brand narrative elements
     cultural_brand_factors: []
     success_stories: []
   ```

## 6. Insights & Learning

1. **Data Structure Flexibility**: YAML's multi-level structure allows for both simple key-value pairs and complex nested data (like success_stories), giving us flexibility to grow without changing the core format.

2. **Cultural Context Is Critical**: The most valuable fields for our brand connection mission aren't just economic statistics but cultural context fields that help understand narrative opportunities.

3. **Balancing Consistency and Uniqueness**: Each market has distinctive characteristics, but maintaining a consistent data structure helps with comparisons and prevents design inconsistencies.

4. **Translation vs. Localization**: Simply translating business terms isn't enough - cultural context in fields like `key_digital_platforms` required proper localization (e.g., "VKontakte" vs "ВКонтакте").

5. **Completeness Is Key**: Having comprehensive data for all 10 markets, rather than just a few key ones, enables us to present BRICS+ as a cohesive trading bloc rather than disconnected markets.

## 7. Next Actions

1. **Asset Management**: Create a plan for sourcing appropriate hero images for each market that follow our design system guidelines.

2. **Template Updates**: Enhance our market templates to use new data fields in the appropriate UI components.

3. **Map Integration**: Integrate market data with our future MapLibre implementation to show brand density by market.

4. **Language Switcher**: Ensure the language switcher works properly with the market pages now that we have complete trilingual data.

5. **Data Validation**: Create schema validation to ensure all required fields are present in future data updates.

6. **Documentation**: Create internal documentation on the market data structure for content maintainers.

7. **Content Update Schedule**: Establish a regular schedule for checking and updating economic data that will become outdated.
