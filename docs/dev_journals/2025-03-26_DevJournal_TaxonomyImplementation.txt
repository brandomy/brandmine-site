# Development Journal: 2025-03-26 - Implementing Taxonomy Structure Changes

## 1. Problem Statement

We needed to update our site's taxonomy structure to align with the new strategy, changing "Growth Signals" to "Signals" and "Countries" to "Markets" across all templates, content files, and layouts to create a more consistent information architecture. This required updates to layouts, collection templates, and content files across all three languages (EN, RU, ZH).

## 2. Approach

1. Create new templates for all content types in the `_docs/templates` directory
2. Update existing layout files to use the new taxonomy terms
3. Rename `growth-signals.md` to `signals.md` and update all internal references
4. Modify all content files to use the new naming conventions
5. Ensure proper URL structures in all files with updated taxonomy terms

## 3. Implementation Details

### Collection Templates
Created template files for all collections with the new taxonomy:
- Brand templates (`brand-en.md`, `brand-ru.md`, `brand-zh.md`)
- Insight templates for four content types:
  - Founder's Journey
  - Brand Spotlight
  - Market Milestone
  - Cultural Signature
- Tag templates for taxonomy types:
  - Sector
  - Market (replacing Country)
  - Attribute
  - Signal (replacing Growth)

```yaml
# Example of updated signal tag front matter
---
title: "Signal Name"
tag: signal-slug
tag_type: signal
description: "Description text"
badge_type: tier2
badge_icon: signal-slug.svg
verification_required: true
permalink: /en/tags/signals/signal-slug/
lang: en
---
```

### Layout Files
Updated the following layouts to use the new taxonomy:
- `insights.html`: Updated to use content types instead of categories
- `content-type.html`: New file replacing `category.html`
- `signals.html`: Updated from `growth.html` with correct tag_type
- `markets.html`: Updated from `countries.html` with correct tag_type
- `brands.html`: Updated filter panel to use new taxonomy

### Include Files
Created new reusable includes:
- `tag-list.html`: For displaying taxonomy tags
- `related-brands-list.html`: For showing related brands
- `brand-card.html`: For consistent brand display
- `content-type-indicator.html`: Visual indicator for insight types
- `featured-content.html`: Highlighting featured content
- `insight-card.html`: Standard card for insights
- `pagination.html`: Reusable pagination component
- `search-filter.html`: Filter controls using new taxonomy

### Content Files
Updated all content files (EN, RU, ZH):
- Changed `growth-signals.md` to `signals.md`
- Updated URL paths in all files from `/tags/growth/` to `/tags/signals/`
- Updated URL paths from `/tags/countries/` to `/tags/markets/`
- Updated tag references from `brand-country` to `brand-market`
- Updated all template content to reflect new terminology

## 4. Decisions Made

1. **Taxonomy Renaming**: We chose "Market" over "Country" to emphasize commercial opportunities rather than political boundaries.

2. **"Market Milestone" over "Major Milestone"**: We selected "Market Milestone" because it's more precise, aligns better with our strategy, offers SEO advantages, creates consistency with our "Markets" taxonomy, and has a more professional tone for our B2B audience.

3. **Template Organization**: We decided to organize templates by collection type first, then language, then content type for clarity and maintainability.

4. **URL Structure**: We maintained a consistent URL pattern:
   ```
   /[language]/tags/[tag_type]s/[tag-slug]/
   ```

5. **Code Structure**: We chose to create specific, self-contained include files rather than embedding functionality in layouts to improve maintainability.

## 6. Insights & Learning

1. **Taxonomy Consistency**: Consistent naming across systems is crucial for both user experience and technical implementation. Changing terms like "Countries" to "Markets" creates better strategic alignment and clearer mental models.

2. **Language Considerations**: When updating multilingual taxonomies, each language may need different grammatical structures or contextual adjustments beyond direct translation.

3. **Template-Driven Development**: Creating standardized templates first saves significant time when implementing collections with consistent parameters.

4. **Include Modularity**: Breaking functionality into granular include files improves maintainability and makes system changes easier to implement.

5. **URL Stability**: When changing terminology, maintaining URL structure consistency helps prevent broken links and SEO issues.

## 7. Next Actions

1. **Update Tag Data**: Update `tag_translations.yml` file with new taxonomy terms.

2. **Create Missing Layouts**: Complete implementation of `insight.html` layout.

3. **Update Language Navigation**: Ensure language switcher maintains correct taxonomy paths.

4. **JSON Data Generation**: Implement JSON data file that uses new taxonomy for search/filtering.

5. **Script Translation Updates**: Consider creating a script to automatically update all taxonomy references in content files.

6. **Tagging Audit**: Review all existing content to ensure consistent tagging under the new taxonomy.

7. **URL Redirection**: Set up redirection for old taxonomy URLs (if any live site exists).

8. **Documentation Update**: Update content contributor guidelines with new taxonomy.
