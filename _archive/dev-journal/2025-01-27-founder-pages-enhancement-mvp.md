=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Task:** Founder Pages MVP Enhancement & Strategic Business Model Alignment
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Founder pages required universal-card system migration for architectural consistency
- Business model clarification revealed founders as paying customers needing dedicated discovery
- Initial implementation included founder content on brands page (strategic misalignment)
- MVP approach needed to avoid feature complexity while maintaining storytelling focus

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created:
  - `_includes/pages/brands/founder-spotlight.html` - Founder spotlight carousel (later removed)
  - `assets/css/pages/brands/founder-spotlight.scss` - Styling for spotlight (later removed)
  - `assets/js/pages/brands/founder-spotlight-carousel.js` - Carousel functionality (later removed)
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-01-27-founder-pages-enhancement-mvp.md` - This journal entry

  - `_includes/pages/home/featured-founders-simplified.html` - Migrated to universal-card
  - `_includes/pages/founder/hero.html` - Applied design token standards
  - `_includes/pages/founder/content.html` - Added content-prose class
  - `_includes/components/cards/founder-test-card.html` - Created temporary wrapper
  - `assets/css/manifest/components.scss` - Commented out founder-test-cards import
  - `assets/css/pages/brands/_index.scss` - Removed founder-spotlight import
  - `_layouts/brands.html` - Removed founder-spotlight JavaScript

- Files moved/deleted:
  - Moved planning documents to `_archive/dev-journal/`
  - Deleted `_includes/pages/brands/founder-spotlight.html`
  - Deleted `assets/css/pages/brands/founder-spotlight.scss`
  - Deleted `assets/js/pages/brands/founder-spotlight-carousel.js`

**Technical Decisions**
- **Universal-card migration**: Chose to migrate all 7 founder card variants to single system
  - Rationale: Architectural consistency with brands page, reduced maintenance overhead
  - Alternative considered: Keep specialized founder cards (rejected for complexity)

- **MVP minimalist approach**: Focused on essential consistency without feature addition
  - Rationale: Avoid cognitive overload, maintain founder storytelling focus
  - Alternative considered: Full homepage pattern replication (rejected as scope creep)

- **Strategic separation**: Complete removal of founder content from brands page
  - Rationale: Business model alignment - founders are paying customers
  - Alternative considered: Cross-promotion between pages (rejected for clarity)

- **Deferred sections**: Commented out filter-interface and founders-grid
  - Rationale: MVP focus on featured/recent discovery only
  - Alternative considered: Remove entirely (rejected to preserve future activation)

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - Universal-card founder configuration in component_defaults.yml
  - Temporary founder-test-card wrapper for dev pages

- Integration points modified:
  - All founder card displays now use universal-card system
  - Design token compliance applied (panel__heading-primary, panel__subtitle)
  - Mobile reading optimization with content-prose class

- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Removed all cross-dependencies between brands and founders pages
  - Consolidated JavaScript from 6 files (future optimization opportunity)
  - Eliminated legacy card component references

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build --limit_posts 3` - Multiple successful builds
  - `time JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` - ~14 second build time

- What worked as expected:
  - Universal-card migration successful across all founder displays
  - Clean separation between brands and founders pages
  - Design token application improved visual consistency
  - Build performance maintained within acceptable range

- Any issues discovered:
  - Initial build failures due to missing founder-test-card component
  - Planning document liquid tags causing build errors (resolved by moving to archive)
  - Minor CSS import issues (resolved by commenting out)

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - JavaScript consolidation opportunity (1,311 lines â†’ target 600 lines)
  - Enhanced mobile touch interactions for carousels
  - Lazy loading implementation for founder images
  - Performance optimization for larger founder datasets

- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Reactivate filter-interface when advanced discovery needed
  - Reactivate founders-grid for comprehensive browsing
  - Consider founder achievement timeline carousel
  - Implement founder expertise discovery dimensions

- Maintenance considerations:
  - Universal-card system simplifies future updates
  - Deferred sections clearly marked with DEFERRED labels
  - Clean architectural separation ensures independent evolution
  - Component defaults centralization enables easy behavior modification
