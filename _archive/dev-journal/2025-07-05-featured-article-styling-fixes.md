=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Task:** Featured Article Styling and Component Integration Fixes
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Featured article section had misaligned content (left-aligned instead of centered)
- Category component was using medium size instead of large for better visual prominence
- Component was not handling underscore-to-hyphen conversion for category IDs from data files
- Investigation was needed to understand the bullet separator implementation
- Overall visual hierarchy needed improvement for the featured article hero section

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified:
  - `assets/css/pages/insights/featured-article.scss` - Added center alignment
  - `_includes/pages/insights/featured-article.html` - Changed category size parameter
  - `_includes/components/ui/insight-category-new.html` - Added underscore conversion logic
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Used `align-items: center` on the flex container rather than individual element alignment for consistency
- Maintained existing dual naming system (underscores in data, hyphens in display) rather than standardizing
- Added conversion logic to the component rather than changing data files to preserve established patterns
- Kept bullet separator as-is since it was working correctly with the `âœ¦` symbol

**Code Changes**
- Modified `.featured-article__content` CSS to add `align-items: center` for centering all child elements
- Updated insight-category-new.html component to handle both underscore and hyphen formats via `replace: "_", "-"`
- Changed category component size parameter from "md" to "lg" for better visual prominence
- No new components created - worked within existing architecture

**Testing Results**
- Commands run: `bundle exec jekyll build --incremental` (multiple times)
- Verified centering works correctly in generated HTML
- Confirmed category shows as "Founder's Journey" with proper indigo styling and large size
- Author translation lookup continues working correctly ("Randal Eastman" not "randal_eastman")
- Image display functioning properly with collection-image component
- Build performance maintained at ~4.5 seconds

**Future Considerations**
- Consider standardizing category naming system across entire codebase (separate task)
- Monitor responsive behavior of centered content on mobile devices
- Potential enhancement: Add size variants to bullet separator component if needed
- Could optimize the dual conversion system in the future for cleaner architecture
- May want to create style guide documentation for category component size usage
