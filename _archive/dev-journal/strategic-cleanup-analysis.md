# Strategic Homepage Cleanup Analysis & Recommendations

**Investigation Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Scope**: Homepage carousel and card systems audit for standardization and cleanup

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive investigation, your homepage architecture is **fundamentally sound** with **minimal cleanup needed**. The recommended section name simplifications create **naming conflicts** and should be **avoided**. However, several **strategic cleanup opportunities** exist for legacy components.

---

## PART 1: SECTION NAME ANALYSIS

### ‚ùå SECTION NAME SIMPLIFICATION NOT RECOMMENDED

**Proposed Simplifications vs Reality:**
```yaml
# CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED - DO NOT CHANGE
featured-brands-simplified ‚Üí brands     # ‚ùå Conflicts with brands: page type
latest-insights ‚Üí insights              # ‚ùå Conflicts with insights: page type  
case-studies ‚Üí cases                    # ‚ùå Unnecessary change
discovery-dimensions ‚Üí discovery        # ‚ùå Conflicts with discovery: page type
founder-focus ‚Üí founders                # ‚ùå Conflicts with founders: page type
impact-statement ‚Üí impact               # ‚ùå Unnecessary change
```

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION:** Keep current section names to maintain clear separation between homepage sections and page types.

## PART 2: CAROUSEL SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ ACTIVE HOMEPAGE CAROUSELS (Keep All)

| Section | CSS Lines | JS Lines | Pattern | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Case Studies** | 300 lines | 127 lines | Universal carousel | ‚úÖ Production ready |
| **Featured Brands** | 326 lines | 93 lines | Universal carousel | ‚úÖ Production ready |
| **Founder Focus** | 360 lines | 183 lines | Universal carousel | ‚úÖ Production ready |
| **Total** | **986 lines** | **403 lines** | Consistent pattern | **Keep all** |

### ‚ùå LEGACY CAROUSEL SYSTEMS (Safe to Remove)

**üü¢ LOW RISK - Safe to Delete:**
```bash
# Legacy carousel components with no external usage
_includes/components/carousels/featured-brands-carousel.html
assets/css/components/carousels/featured-brands-carousel.scss

# Legacy standalone carousel files  
assets/css/components/case-studies-carousel.css
assets/js/components/case-studies-carousel.js
assets/js/components/insights-carousel.js

# Test/experimental carousel files
_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel.html
_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel-dual.html
assets/css/components/founders-carousel.scss
assets/js/components/founder-carousel.js
```

**Savings:** ~800-1000 lines of unused carousel code

---

## PART 3: CARD COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ HOMEPAGE CARDS (Keep All - Required)

**Active homepage cards verified:**
- `insight-latest-card.html` ‚Üí Latest Insights 2x2 grid
- `simplified-brand-card.html` ‚Üí Featured Brands carousel  
- `founder-focus-card.html` ‚Üí Founder Focus carousel
- Inline case study cards ‚Üí Case Studies carousel

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CARD PROLIFERATION FINDINGS

**Card variant counts identified:**
- **Insight cards**: 5 variants (1 homepage + 4 legacy)
- **Founder cards**: 6 variants (1 homepage + 5 legacy) 
- **Brand cards**: 4 variants (1 homepage + 3 legacy)

### üü¢ LOW RISK CLEANUP - Safe to Remove

**Test/Experimental Cards:**
```bash
# Explicitly marked as test component
_includes/components/cards/founder-test-card.html
assets/css/components/founder-test-cards.scss

# Unused tagged variant (1 self-reference only)
_includes/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.html  
assets/css/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.scss

# Week 3 experimental enhancements
assets/css/components/cards/week3-insight-enhancements.scss
```

### üü° MEDIUM RISK - Investigation Needed

**Cards with limited usage requiring verification:**
```bash
# Used in founder-focus-intense (homepage variant not active)
_includes/components/cards/founder-intense-card.html
assets/css/components/founder-intense-cards.scss

# Used in featured-founders-simplified (may be legacy)  
_includes/components/cards/simplified-founder-card.html
assets/css/components/cards/simplified-founder-card.scss
```

### ‚úÖ HIGH USAGE CARDS (Keep All)

**Core cards with 8+ usage references:**
- `insight-card.html` (13 uses) - Main insight display across site
- `founder-card.html` (8 uses) - Main founder display across site  
- `brand-card.html` (13 uses) - Main brand display across site

---

## PART 4: STANDARDIZATION ASSESSMENT

### ‚úÖ HOMEPAGE CARDS MEET MINIMALIST STANDARDS

**Standards compliance verified:**
- **Design tokens**: Heavy use of `var(--space-*, --color-*)` 
- **Mobile-first**: All responsive with progressive enhancement
- **Universal patterns**: Consistent carousel implementation
- **Clean design**: Minimal visual complexity, no excessive badges/tags

### ‚ùå NON-STANDARD COMPONENTS (Cleanup Targets)

**Anti-patterns identified:**
1. `tagged-insight-card.html` - Excessive tag complexity (27 hardcoded values)
2. `founder-test-card.html` - Test component with emoji usage
3. Multiple variant proliferation without clear differentiation

---

## PART 5: SPECIFIC CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### üü¢ IMMEDIATE SAFE CLEANUP (Zero Risk)

**Execute immediately - no dependencies:**
```bash
# Remove test/experimental files (confirmed safe)
rm _includes/components/cards/founder-test-card.html
rm assets/css/components/founder-test-cards.scss
rm assets/css/components/week3-insight-enhancements.scss

# Remove unused legacy carousel files
rm _includes/components/carousels/featured-brands-carousel.html
rm assets/css/components/carousels/featured-brands-carousel.scss
rm assets/css/components/case-studies-carousel.css

# Remove tagged insights (single self-reference)
rm _includes/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.html
rm assets/css/components/cards/tagged-insight-card.scss
```

**Estimated cleanup:** ~15-20 files, 1000+ lines of code

### üü° REQUIRES INVESTIGATION (Medium Risk)

**Check before removal:**
```bash
# Verify these are actually unused before deletion
_includes/pages/home/founder-focus-intense.html          # Check if referenced
_includes/pages/home/featured-founders-simplified.html   # Check if referenced  
_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel.html          # Appears unused
_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel-dual.html     # Appears unused
```

### ‚ùå DO NOT REMOVE (High Risk)

**Keep all active homepage components:**
- All files in `/pages/home/` that are in page_sections.yml
- All cards used by active homepage sections
- All CSS/JS for active homepage carousels

---

## PART 6: VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Current State Documentation

```bash
# File counts before cleanup
find _includes/components/cards -name "*" | wc -l      # 24 card components
find assets/css -name "*carousel*" | wc -l            # 6 carousel CSS files  
find assets/js -name "*carousel*" | wc -l             # 6 carousel JS files

# Usage verification  
grep -r "simplified-brand-card" _includes/ | wc -l    # 2 references
grep -r "insight-latest-card" _includes/ | wc -l      # 2 references
grep -r "founder-focus-card" _includes/ | wc -l       # 2 references
```

### Post-Cleanup Verification

```bash
# Verify homepage still works after cleanup
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Check for broken references
grep -r "founder-test-card" _includes/        # Should return nothing
grep -r "tagged-insight-card" _includes/      # Should return nothing
grep -r "week3-insight" _includes/            # Should return nothing
```
