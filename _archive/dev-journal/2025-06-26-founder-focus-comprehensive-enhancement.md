=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 26, 2025
**Task:** Founder Focus Carousel Comprehensive Enhancement
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Founder Focus carousel lacked auto-advance functionality, reducing user engagement
- Mobile cards were cropped by 10% due to viewport calculation issues
- Content overflow extended beyond card boundaries (visible as purple dotted lines)
- Section spacing inconsistent with other homepage sections (118px vs standard 64px)
- Title styling used custom classes instead of standard design system patterns

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-06-26-founder-focus-auto-advance.md` (auto-advance documentation)
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-06-26-founder-focus-spacing-fix.md` (spacing fix documentation)
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-06-26-founder-focus-title-standardization.md` (title standardization)
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-06-26-mobile-carousel-responsiveness-fix.md` (mobile responsiveness)
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-06-26-founder-card-content-overflow-fix.md` (content overflow fix)

- Files modified:
  - `assets/js/pages/home/founder-focus.js` (added comprehensive auto-advance functionality)
  - `assets/css/pages/home/founder-focus.scss` (spacing, responsiveness, and overflow fixes)
  - `_includes/pages/home/founder-focus.html` (removed duplicate section wrapper, standardized title class)

- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- **Auto-advance Pattern**: Chose intelligent pausing over simple continuous advance to respect user intent
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Applied proven percentage-based sizing instead of viewport calculations 
- **Content Containment**: Used layered overflow protection rather than single-point fixes
- **Spacing Standardization**: Leveraged existing panel system instead of custom section wrappers
- **Title Consistency**: Adopted `panel__heading-secondary` class for design system alignment

**Code Changes**
- **New Auto-advance System**: Added CONFIG-driven timing with comprehensive user interaction detection
- **Responsive Card Sizing**: Switched from `calc(100vw - 3rem)` to `flex: 0 0 100%` mobile-first pattern
- **Content Overflow Protection**: Added `overflow: hidden` and `box-sizing: border-box` throughout card hierarchy
- **Section Structure**: Removed duplicate wrapper, now uses standard panel pattern exclusively
- **Typography Integration**: Replaced custom title styles with standard `panel__heading-secondary`

**Testing Results**
- **Build Performance**: Maintained 14.5 seconds (under 15s target) ✅
- **Auto-advance Functionality**: 6-second intervals with smart pausing working correctly ✅
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Cards now display fully on all devices (375px+) ✅
- **Content Containment**: No overflow visible, all elements stay within boundaries ✅
- **Cross-language Testing**: EN/RU/ZH all functioning identically ✅
- **Visual Consistency**: Spacing now matches other homepage sections ✅

**Future Considerations**
- **Timing Optimization**: Current 6-second interval could be A/B tested against 8-10 second alternatives
- **Advanced Interactions**: Consider adding pause/play button for explicit user control
- **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for any impact as content volume grows
- **Content Strategy**: Monitor if auto-advance affects engagement vs. manual browsing
- **Accessibility Enhancement**: Could add announcements for screen readers on slide changes
