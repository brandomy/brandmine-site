**Date:** January 26, 2025
**Task:** Discovery Dimensions Translation and Count Fix
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Discovery Dimensions section on homepage displayed hardcoded English text in Russian/Chinese versions
- Count lines showed static "+9 more", "+10 more", "+2 more" instead of actual dimension quantities
- "Explore All Discovery Paths" button was not translated across languages
- Dimension card titles used wrong translation keys (tags.* instead of discovery.*)
- Users in non-English locales saw mixed language content, breaking the user experience

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified: 
  - `_data/translations/en.yml` - Added discovery dimension titles and count labels
  - `_data/translations/ru.yml` - Added Russian translations for titles and count labels  
  - `_data/translations/zh.yml` - Added Chinese translations for titles and count labels
  - `_includes/components/cards/dimension-card.html` - Fixed title translation key references
  - `_includes/components/dimensions/discovery-dimensions-grid.html` - Added button translation logic
  - `_includes/components/dimensions/dimension-tag-cloud.html` - Replaced "+X more" with total counts
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Used hardcoded multilingual text for count labels instead of complex translation helper due to implementation complexity
- Maintained existing data structure and counting logic rather than restructuring dimension data
- Applied conditional language logic directly in templates for immediate resolution
- Chose total counts ("15 markets") over remaining counts ("+9 more") for better user clarity
- Used actual data quantities (Markets: 15, Sectors: 16, Attributes: 8, Signals: 4) calculated from JSON files

**Code Changes**
- Translation keys added:
  - `discovery.markets/sectors/attributes/signals` for card titles
  - `discovery.count_markets/sectors/attributes/signals` for count labels (attempted but fell back to hardcoded)
  - `discovery.explore_all_paths` for main CTA button
- Modified dimension-card.html to use `discovery.*` keys instead of `tags.*`
- Enhanced discovery-dimensions-grid.html with translation helper for button text
- Replaced dynamic remaining count logic with total count display in dimension-tag-cloud.html
- Applied language-specific conditional rendering: EN/RU/ZH variants for each dimension type

**Testing Results**
- Commands run: `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` (multiple iterations)
- Build time: Consistently ~20-21 seconds (within acceptable range)
- Cross-language verification:
  - English: "15 markets", "16 sectors", "8 attributes", "4 signals" ✓
  - Russian: "15 рынков", "16 секторов", "8 атрибутов", "4 сигналов" ✓  
  - Chinese: "15 个市场", "16 个行业", "8 个属性", "4 个信号" ✓
- Button translations verified across all three languages
- Card titles properly localized in all language versions

**Future Considerations**
- Translation helper system may need debugging for complex nested keys (discovery.count_* keys didn't resolve properly)
- Consider implementing automated count synchronization if dimension data changes frequently
- Could optimize by moving hardcoded translations back to YAML files once helper system is debugged
- May want to add validation to ensure count accuracy if dimension data is updated
- Consider implementing dynamic language detection for better maintainability of multilingual conditional logic
