=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 27, 2025
**Task:** Universal Carousel System Implementation & Legacy Cleanup
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brandmine site had 3 different carousel systems running simultaneously with significant code duplication (~265+ lines)
- Fragmented carousel architecture made maintenance difficult and future development inefficient
- Legacy carousel files and test sections were cluttering the codebase and causing confusion
- Mobile responsive issues in Case Studies carousel after Phase 4 consolidation
- Homepage contained experimental test sections alongside production carousels

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - Enhanced `assets/js/components/carousels/universal-carousel.js` with 280+ lines of advanced features
  - Comprehensive responsive mixins in `assets/css/components/carousels/universal-carousel.scss`
- Files modified:
  - `assets/js/pages/home/featured-brands-simplified.js` - Converted to use universal patterns (94â†’58 lines)
  - `assets/js/pages/home/case-studies-section.js` - Integrated universal functions while preserving dynamic dots
  - `assets/js/pages/home/founder-focus.js` - Minimal integration preserving auto-advance functionality
  - `assets/css/components/carousels/universal-carousel.scss` - Added responsive mixins and animation systems
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Removed test sections, cleaned homepage structure
  - `_layouts/home.html` - Updated script references
- Files moved/deleted:
  - Removed `assets/js/components/case-studies-carousel.js` (127 lines legacy)
  - Removed `assets/js/pages/home/carousels.js` (70 lines legacy)
  - Removed test section includes: `case-studies-carousel.html`, `featured-brands-carousel.html`, `featured-founders-carousel.html`
  - Backed up all removed files to `_archive/` directories

**Technical Decisions**
- **Opt-in Enhancement Model**: Advanced features (auto-advance, touch support, accessibility) are optional to preserve backward compatibility
- **Mobile-First Responsive Strategy**: Used CSS mixins with standardized breakpoints (480px, 768px, 992px)
- **Case Studies Special Handling**: Required custom `.test-card` targeting instead of generic `> *` selectors due to unique HTML structure
- **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Used `@include carousel-responsive()` patterns for easy future carousel creation
- **Preserved Unique Behaviors**: Maintained founder-focus auto-advance, case studies dynamic dots, and component-specific responsive layouts
- **Safe Removal Strategy**: Created backups and verified functionality before removing any legacy files

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - `UniversalCarousel.addAutoAdvance()` - Configurable auto-advance with reduced motion support
  - `UniversalCarousel.addTouchSupport()` - Mobile swipe gestures
  - `UniversalCarousel.addKeyboardNavigation()` - Full accessibility compliance
  - `UniversalCarousel.addAccessibilityFeatures()` - ARIA live regions and screen reader support
  - Responsive mixins: `@mixin carousel-responsive()`, `@mixin carousel-fade-in-cards()`, etc.
- Integration points modified:
  - All page-specific carousel files now use universal `init()`, `addScrollHandler()`, `addDotHandlers()`
  - CSS consolidation through universal component with component-specific overrides
  - Removed duplicate responsive patterns from page-specific files
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Homepage sections reduced from 16 to 13 (removed test duplicates)
  - Single source of truth for all carousel functionality
  - Clean separation between universal patterns and component-specific behaviors

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - Successful builds throughout all phases (13.7-14.6 seconds)
  - `curl -s http://localhost:4000/en/` - Verified site accessibility
  - Manual testing of all carousel functionality across breakpoints
- What worked as expected:
  - All existing carousels (Case Studies, Featured Brands, Founder Focus) maintained exact functionality
  - Advanced features accessible via opt-in API calls
  - Responsive behavior consistent across all screen sizes
  - No breaking changes to production carousel systems
- Any issues discovered:
  - Case Studies mobile responsive issue after Phase 4 - resolved with custom `.test-card` targeting
  - Generic responsive mixins didn't work for Case Studies unique HTML structure
  - Required layout file updates to remove references to deleted legacy files

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Brands and Founders pages can now easily implement rich carousels using the universal system
  - Advanced features (animations, auto-advance, touch support) ready for premium carousel experiences
  - Consider implementing carousel lazy loading for performance optimization
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Update documentation to reflect new universal carousel API
  - Consider consolidating insights-carousel.js with universal system for insights page
  - Evaluate founder-carousel.js on founders page for potential universal system integration
- Maintenance considerations:
  - All future carousel development should use universal system exclusively
  - Monitor for any responsive edge cases across different devices
  - Consider adding automated tests for carousel functionality to prevent regressions
  - Keep advanced features documented for team development reference

**Overall Achievement**
Successfully consolidated ~742+ lines of carousel functionality into a single, feature-rich universal system while maintaining perfect backward compatibility. Eliminated all legacy code and test sections, resulting in a clean, maintainable architecture ready for professional carousel development across the entire site.
