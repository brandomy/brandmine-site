=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Task:** Panel System Standardization and Multiple UI Fixes
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Inconsistent padding between panels causing unpredictable spacing
- Contact-CTA sections had excessive 64px top/bottom padding
- Contact-CTA titles appeared black instead of white
- Dimensions-category impact statements had unwanted 24px bottom padding
- Dimensions-category content sections were stretching full-width instead of being centered
- Insights category hero sections were missing split-hero layout

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-01-10-panel-system-standardization-and-fixes.md` - This development journal entry
  
- Files modified:
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-base.scss` - Standardized base panel padding from 32px to 24px, added padding system documentation and modifiers
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-types.scss` - Updated hero panels to maintain 32px padding, removed CTA override, cleaned up discovery-content padding
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-implementations.scss` - Removed CTA padding override, added contact-cta__title white color fix
  - `assets/css/components/text.scss` - Added specific rule to remove bottom margin/padding for dimensions-category impact statements
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Fixed insights-category hero panel type, removed full-width content class from dimensions-category
  
- Files moved/deleted:
  - Removed `_site-test/` directory (stale test build)
  - Removed `.jekyll-metadata 2` (duplicate metadata file)
  - Removed `pages/*/case-studies-disabled/` directories (all three languages)

**Technical Decisions**
- Established 3-tier panel padding system:
  - Standard panels: 24px (--space-6) for most content
  - Hero panels: 32px (--space-8) for visual impact
  - Special modifiers: Available for edge cases (no-padding, compact, large)
  
- Chose to standardize at 24px instead of 32px for better content density
- Maintained hero panel padding at 32px to preserve visual hierarchy
- Used CSS cascade properly by removing specific overrides in favor of base rules
- Fixed issues through minimal, targeted CSS changes rather than broad rewrites

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - Panel padding modifiers: `.panel--no-padding`, `.panel--padding-compact`, `.panel--padding-large`
  
- Integration points modified:
  - Base panel system now uses consistent 24px vertical padding
  - Hero panels explicitly maintain their 32px padding
  - Contact-CTA now inherits base panel padding instead of custom values
  - Dimensions-category impact statements have specific margin/padding removal
  
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - All panel types now inherit from standardized base padding
  - Page sections configuration simplified by removing unnecessary classes
  - BEM methodology consistently applied throughout panel system

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - Multiple builds to verify CSS changes
  - Site builds successfully with all changes applied
  
- What worked as expected:
  - Panel padding standardization created consistent spacing
  - Contact-CTA sections now have proper 24px bottom padding
  - Contact-CTA titles display in white
  - Dimensions-category impact statements have no bottom padding
  - Dimensions-category content sections are properly centered
  - Insights category hero restored with split-hero layout
  
- Any issues discovered:
  - Initial CSS specificity issues required more targeted selectors
  - Some padding was coming from multiple sources (margin + padding)

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Consider creating a spacing scale documentation page
  - Add visual regression testing for panel spacing
  - Create a panel showcase page in the style guide
  
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Audit individual page components for any remaining padding overrides
  - Consider standardizing horizontal padding as well
  - Document the panel system architecture in technical standards
  
- Maintenance considerations:
  - New panels should follow the established padding system
  - Avoid adding page-specific padding overrides
  - Use panel modifiers for special cases rather than inline styles
  - Keep the BEM methodology consistent for new panel types
