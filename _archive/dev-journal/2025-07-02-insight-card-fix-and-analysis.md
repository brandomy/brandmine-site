=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** July 2, 2025
**Task:** Insight Card HTML Structure Fix and Build Performance Analysis
**Status:** Partial - HTML fixed, CSS compilation issue discovered

**Problem Statement**
- Insight cards were stacking vertically instead of displaying in grid layout
- Individual cards were expanding beyond specified width (362×520px)
- Build times had dramatically improved from ~20s to <4s without clear explanation
- Test 2 output was appearing inside Test 1's article tag (HTML structure corruption)
- CSS styles for insight cards were not being applied despite imports being correct

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `/pages/en/test/insight-card-debug.md` - Isolated debug test page
  - `/Users/randaleastman/Documents/brandmine-site/_archive/dev-journal/2025-07-02-insight-card-fix-and-analysis.md` - This journal entry
- Files modified: 
  - `/_includes/components/cards/insight-card.html` - Fixed unclosed div tag at line 52
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Used HTML structure analysis to identify unclosed tags (11 opening vs 10 closing divs)
- Fixed missing `</div>` for the first conditional branch in insight-card.html
- Conducted comprehensive build performance analysis to understand <4s build times
- Performed CSS compilation verification to identify root cause of styling issues

**Code Changes**
- Fixed HTML structure in insight-card.html:
  ```liquid
  {% if include.insight.images.hero %}
    <div class="insight-card__hero">
      {% include components/images/collection-image.html ... %}
    </div>  <!-- Added this missing closing tag -->
  {% elsif include.insight.hero_image %}
  ```
- No new components created
- Dependencies: All insight card implementations affected by HTML fix

**Testing Results**
- Commands run:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build --incremental` (5 consecutive builds)
  - `grep -c "insight-card" _site/assets/main.css`
  - `awk` analysis for div tag counting
- What worked:
  - HTML structure now balanced (11 opening, 11 closing divs)
  - Build times consistent at 3.8-4.1 seconds
  - 286 pages building correctly
- Issues discovered:
  - **CRITICAL**: CSS compilation failure - insight-card styles NOT in main.css
  - Despite proper imports and valid Sass syntax, classes not compiling
  - This explains why cards render without styling

**Future Considerations**
- Immediate need: Resolve CSS compilation issue before any consolidation work
- Component consolidation plan ready (5→3 components) pending CSS fix
- BEM standardization identified:
  - Remove grid/container references from card CSS
  - Consolidate multiple namespaces (insight-card__, insight-item__, etc.)
- Performance monitoring: Understand why HTML fix improved build times
- Test page recommendations:
  - Keep: insight-card.html (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), featured-insight-card.html (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
  - Remove: insight-latest-card.html, tagged-insight-card.html

**Root Cause Analysis**
The unclosed HTML tag in insight-card.html was causing:
1. HTML structure corruption (nested article tags)
2. CSS compilation to fail silently
3. Jekyll processing issues affecting build performance

While the HTML fix resolved structural issues and improved build times, the CSS compilation failure remains the critical blocker for proper insight card functionality.
