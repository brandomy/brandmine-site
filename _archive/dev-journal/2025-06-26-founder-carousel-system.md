=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 26, 2025
**Task:** Founder Carousel System Implementation & Testing
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brandmine needed an engaging carousel system for 50% portrait founder cards to maximize storytelling impact
- Existing founder-focus carousel had non-functional dot navigation that needed fixing
- Required comparison between single-card (emotional depth) vs dual-card (discovery efficiency) approaches
- Needed architectural consistency with existing Brandmine carousel systems while supporting new 50% portrait layouts

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 3 new components (founders-carousel.html, founders-carousel-dual.html, founders-carousel.scss)
- Files modified: 4 existing files (founder-carousel.js, components.scss manifest, founders-test.html, founder-test-cards.scss)
- Files moved/deleted: None
- System extended: Enhanced existing carousel architecture to support multiple founder card layouts

**Technical Decisions**
- **Architectural Consistency**: Extended existing carousel patterns from featured-brands-carousel rather than creating completely new system
- **JavaScript Enhancement**: Enhanced existing founder-carousel.js to support both legacy and new carousel types with backward compatibility
- **CSS Extension**: Added dual-carousel styles to existing founders-carousel.scss for maintainable single-file approach
- **Component Separation**: Created separate dual-carousel component for clear differentiation while reusing core card components
- **Navigation System**: Implemented both founder-focus-nav-dot (legacy) and carousel-dot (new) systems for flexibility

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - `_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel.html` - Single-card carousel with 50% portrait optimization
  - `_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel-dual.html` - Dual-card comparison carousel
  - `assets/css/components/founders-carousel.scss` - Complete carousel styling system
- Integration points modified:
  - Enhanced `assets/js/components/founder-carousel.js` with `initializeFoundersCarousel()` function
  - Updated `assets/css/manifest/components.scss` to include new carousel styles
  - Extended `pages/en/dev/founders-test.html` with interactive carousel testing sections
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Leverages existing `founder-test-card.html` components for consistent 50% portrait layouts
  - Integrates with existing design token system (--space-*, --accent-*, etc.)
  - Maintains compatibility with existing founder-focus carousel system

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - All builds successful (20.9-21.3 seconds)
  - `find` commands to verify file structure and relationships
  - `grep` commands to check carousel integration patterns
- What worked as expected:
  - Single-card carousel with functional dot navigation and smooth scrolling
  - Dual-card carousel with side-by-side founder comparison
  - Mobile responsive behavior with proper stacking
  - JavaScript enhancement supporting both carousel types
  - CSS compilation with no conflicts
- Any issues discovered:
  - Initial dot navigation required JavaScript refactoring for proper event handling
  - Image path corrections needed (farming vs formal filename consistency)
  - Achievement box padding required optimization for tighter presentation

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Auto-play functionality for carousel rotation
  - Swipe gesture support for mobile touch interactions
  - Lazy loading optimization for founder portrait images
  - Analytics integration to track carousel engagement patterns
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Integration with actual founder data from Jekyll collections
  - A/B testing framework to measure single vs dual carousel effectiveness
  - Accessibility enhancements for screen readers and keyboard navigation
  - Performance optimization for carousel rendering with large founder datasets
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Monitor carousel JavaScript performance as founder count grows
  - Regular testing of responsive behavior across device types
  - Version compatibility with future Jekyll and design token updates
  - Documentation updates for team members implementing founder carousels

**Implementation Impact**
This implementation successfully creates a production-ready founder carousel system that:
- Extends Brandmine's existing carousel architecture with architectural consistency
- Provides both single-card (emotional depth) and dual-card (discovery efficiency) storytelling approaches
- Maintains 50% portrait layout optimization for maximum founder visual impact
- Offers interactive comparison testing for data-driven decision making on optimal carousel approach
- Supports the "Founder IS the brand story" philosophy through engaging, responsive carousel experiences
