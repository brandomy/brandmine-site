**Date:** January 2, 2025
**Task:** Founder & Brand Card Testing Structure Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Founder cards test page had outdated sections (Location Display Optimization, Layout Compatibility Assessment) that were no longer relevant after component architecture improvements
- Brand cards test page lacked comprehensive Section 0 structure for systematic A/B testing like the founder cards test page
- Production founder-card-featured.html component was showing country name instead of city in location format (ðŸ”— Company â€¢ Russia vs. ðŸ”— Company â€¢ Moscow)
- Missing visual debugging toolkit on founder cards test page for layout troubleshooting
- Inconsistent testing structure between founder and brand card test pages made comparison difficult

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None (all modifications to existing files)
- Files modified:
  - `/pages/en/test/founder-cards-layout-testing.md` - Removed outdated sections, added debugging toolkit
  - `/pages/en/test/brand-cards-layout-testing.md` - Complete Section 0 restructure with 6 variants (1A/1B, 2A/2B, 3A/3B, 4A)
  - `/_includes/components/cards/founder-card-featured.html` - Fixed location format and ordering issues
  - `/_includes/pages/home/founder-focus.html` - Updated founder ordering logic (reverted)
- Files moved/deleted: Removed ~155 lines of outdated content from founder cards test page

**Technical Decisions**
- Chose to replicate founder cards Section 0 structure exactly in brand cards for consistency
- Implemented 6 distinct test variants covering all brand card usage patterns:
  - 1A/1B: Standard brand-card.html variations
  - 2A/2B: Featured variant (variant="featured") variations  
  - 3A: Production brands page (using brand-card-selector.html)
  - 3B: Production homepage featured brands carousel
  - 4A: Latest brands section grid layout
- Added visual debugging toolkit matching brand cards implementation for consistency
- Used CSS variant classes (.brand-card-variant-b, .brand-card-featured-variant-b) for A/B testing overrides
- Fixed location format to show City + Flag instead of Country + Flag for better geographical specificity

**Code Changes**
- New CSS classes created:
  - `.brand-card-variant-b` - Standard card A/B testing styles
  - `.brand-card-featured-variant-a/b` - Featured card A/B testing containers
  - `.debug-layout`, `.debug-grid`, `.debug-ruler`, `.debug-box-model` - Visual debugging classes for founder cards
- Integration points modified:
  - Brand cards Section 0 now matches founder cards structure with source documentation
  - Founder cards debugging toolkit integrated with existing script section
  - Production founder card component location format corrected
- Dependencies affected:
  - Both test pages now use consistent CSS and JavaScript debugging infrastructure
  - Cross-references between brand card usage patterns clearly documented with source files

**Testing Results**
- Commands run: `bundle exec jekyll build --quiet` (multiple times during implementation)
- What worked as expected:
  - All 6 brand card variants render correctly with distinct styling
  - Debugging toolkit functions properly on founder cards test page
  - Production founder card shows correct "ðŸ”— Company â€¢ City Flag" format
  - Source documentation boxes accurately reflect file dependencies
- Issues discovered and resolved:
  - Initial founder ordering issue (user corrected that it wasn't a problem)
  - Location format showing country instead of city (fixed in production component)

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements:
  - Could add more sophisticated A/B testing framework with analytics integration
  - Consider consolidating visual debugging toolkit into shared component
  - May want to add performance metrics comparison between variants
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Apply similar comprehensive testing structure to insight cards if they exist
  - Consider implementing automated visual regression testing for card variants
  - Document A/B testing guidelines and best practices for design team
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Keep source documentation updated when file structures change
  - Ensure variant styling remains visually distinct for effective A/B testing
  - Monitor that debugging toolkit doesn't interfere with production builds
  - Validate that all card components maintain consistent parameter interfaces
