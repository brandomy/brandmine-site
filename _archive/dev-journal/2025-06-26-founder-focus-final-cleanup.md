**Date:** June 26, 2025
**Task:** Founder Focus Final Cleanup - Spacing & Generation Badge Removal
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- User reported excessive top spacing in founder section compared to other site panels
- Generation badges were no longer needed and cluttering the card design
- Need to maintain consistent spacing patterns across all homepage sections

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None (cleanup task)
- Files modified: 
  - `assets/css/pages/home/founder-focus.scss` - Removed all generation badge CSS
  - `_includes/components/cards/founder-focus-card.html` - Removed generation badge HTML
  - `_data/translations/en.yml` - Removed generation translations
  - `_data/translations/ru.yml` - Removed generation translations  
  - `_data/translations/zh.yml` - Removed generation translations
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Investigated spacing using section padding values and determined founder section already follows standard pattern
- Chose complete removal of generation badge system rather than just hiding it
- Maintained portrait container `overflow: hidden` for clean image display
- Preserved all other card functionality while removing generation-specific code

**Code Changes**
- Removed `.founder-focus-card__generation` CSS class and all related styles
- Removed generation badge HTML block from card template
- Removed `founders.featured.generation` translation keys from all language files
- Cleaned up portrait container CSS by restoring proper overflow handling
- No new components or helpers needed for this cleanup task

**Testing Results**
- Build completed successfully in 14.401 seconds
- Verified spacing matches other homepage sections (var(--space-8) top/bottom padding)
- Confirmed generation badges completely removed from UI
- All language files properly cleaned of generation references
- Portrait images display correctly with proper overflow handling

**Future Considerations**
- Monitor for any references to generation badges in other components
- Consider standardizing card cleanup patterns for future badge removals
- Spacing investigation approach could be documented for future reference
- Generation badge removal pattern could be template for other feature deprecations
