=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Task:** Documentation Reorganization and Archive Cleanup
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Documentation had grown to 1730+ lines in a single file making navigation difficult
- _docs/archive/ folder contained 21 legacy files of unclear status
- Need to achieve lean documentation principles with 30-second discoverability
- Unclear whether archive content was actively used or truly archived

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created:
  - `_templates/tutorials/workflows/complete-workflows.md` - Extracted operational workflows (601 lines)
  - `_templates/tutorials/troubleshooting/complete-troubleshooting.md` - Extracted troubleshooting guides (512 lines)
  - `_docs/technical-standards.md` - Streamlined core standards (324 lines)
  - This journal entry

- Files modified:
  - `_docs/brandmine-guide.md` - Updated cross-references to new template locations
  - `_docs/current-status.md` - Updated with reorganization achievements

- Files moved/deleted:
  - Moved `_docs/archive/` → `_archive/documentation/insight-legacy-components/`
  - Archived original 1730-line technical-standards.md → `_archive/documentation/technical-standards-consolidated.md`
  - Archived `component-reference.md` → `_archive/documentation/`
  - Deleted consolidated files `setup-and-workflows.md` and `troubleshooting-and-tools.md`

**Technical Decisions**
- Separated operational procedures from architectural standards
  - Core standards remain in _docs/ for Jekyll processing
  - Operational workflows moved to _templates/tutorials/ for context-aware discovery
- Evidence-based approach to archive analysis:
  - Conducted comprehensive diagnostic to determine archive status
  - Found zero active references to _docs/archive content
  - Confirmed Jekyll builds without dependency on archive
  - Archive README explicitly documented legacy status
- Maintained 3-file core documentation limit for lean principles

**Code Changes**
- No component or helper changes required
- Updated documentation cross-references in brandmine-guide.md
- Preserved all content through systematic archival
- No impact on Jekyll build process or site functionality

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build --quiet` - Build successful
  - `find _docs -name "*.md" | wc -l` - Confirmed 3 core files
  - `wc -l _docs/*.md` - All files under 350 lines (target: <600)
- What worked as expected:
  - Jekyll builds successfully without archived content
  - All documentation content preserved in appropriate locations
  - 30-second navigation restored through streamlined structure
- No issues discovered during implementation

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements:
  - Consider further breakdown of workflows into specific task templates
  - May want to create index files for template navigation
  - Could add automated documentation validation scripts
- Related tasks:
  - Regular audits to prevent documentation bloat
  - Template system could be expanded for other operational guides
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Maintain 3-file limit in _docs/ root
  - Use templates for procedural content
  - Keep core documentation focused on architecture and standards
  - Archive obsolete content promptly to prevent confusion

**Metrics Achievement:**
- Reduced core documentation from 1730 lines to 745 total (57% reduction)
- Individual files: 189, 232, 324 lines (all under 350-line target)
- Achieved true lean documentation with operational/architectural separation
- Restored 30-second discoverability for all content
- Zero build errors or dependencies affected
