**Date:** 2025-07-03
**Task:** Dimension Card Component Rename and Mobile Layout Overflow Fixes
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- The `dimension-card.html` component was misnamed - it displays dimension categories (sectors, markets, attributes, signals), not individual dimensions
- Component contained redundant tag cloud functionality that wasn't rendering properly
- Mobile devices (iPhone SE 375px, Galaxy S8+ 360px) experienced card overflow beyond page margins due to insufficient container padding calculations
- Fixed card widths (345px mobile, 360px desktop) were exceeding available viewport space after panel container padding was applied

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_includes/components/cards/dimension-category-card.html` (simplified 60-line component)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/dimension-category-card.scss` (renamed and updated CSS classes)
- Files modified:
  - `_includes/components/dimensions/discovery-dimensions-grid.html` (updated component references)
  - `pages/en/test/dimension-cards-layout-testing.md` (updated all references and file paths)
  - `_data/component_defaults.yml` (simplified configuration)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/_index.scss` (updated CSS import)
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-base.scss` (responsive padding fix)
  - `_includes/helpers/dimension-name.html` (documentation update)
- Files moved/deleted:
  - Deleted: `_includes/components/cards/dimension-card.html` (122 lines)
  - Deleted: `assets/css/components/cards/dimension-card.scss`

**Technical Decisions**
- **Component Rename**: Changed to `dimension-category-card.html` for semantic clarity - reflects that it displays navigation cards for dimension categories, not individual dimension items
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed non-functional tag cloud includes and complex configuration parameters, reducing component from 122 to 60 lines
- **Mobile-First Preservation**: Maintained existing card width tokens (`--card-width-atomic: 345px`, `--card-width-standard: 360px`) rather than making cards fully flexible
- **Systematic Container Fix**: Applied responsive padding to `.panel__content` class rather than modifying individual card components - fixes overflow issue for entire card system
- **Layout Constraints**: Enforced only 1x4, 2x2, or 4x1 grid layouts as specified, preventing 3-column displays

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created: None (simplified existing component)
- Integration points modified:
  - `discovery-dimensions-grid.html` now includes `dimension-category-card.html`
  - All test pages updated to reference new component name
  - CSS manifest updated with new import statement
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Removed dependency on `components/dimensions/dimension-tag-cloud.html`
  - Simplified `component_defaults.yml` configuration from 4 parameters to 1
  - Universal panel system now accommodates mobile card widths

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - Successful (6.172 seconds)
  - Multiple responsive layout tests across device sizes
- What worked as expected:
  - Component rename and simplification completed without breaking functionality
  - Grid responsive behavior: 1x4 mobile, 2x2 tablet, 4x1 large desktop (1600px+)
  - Mobile overflow resolved on iPhone SE (375px) and Galaxy S8+ (360px)
- Any issues discovered:
  - Original panel padding (`var(--space-6)` = 24px each side) consumed 48px total width
  - Math: iPhone SE 375px - 48px = 327px available < 345px cards = overflow
  - Fixed with responsive padding: 4px (â‰¤374px), 8px (375-767px), 24px (768px+)

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Monitor if other card components experience similar mobile overflow issues
  - Consider creating utility classes for consistent card width management
  - Evaluate if tag cloud functionality should be completely removed or reimplemented properly
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Verify all brand card, founder card, and insight card layouts work correctly with new panel padding
  - Update documentation to reflect component rename and simplified architecture
  - Consider consolidating remaining card width token usage patterns
- Maintenance considerations:
  - New card components should use the established mobile-first width token system
  - Panel padding changes affect all page sections - test thoroughly when modifying
  - Component defaults configuration is now minimal and easier to maintain
