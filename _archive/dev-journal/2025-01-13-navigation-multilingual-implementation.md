=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 13, 2025
**Task:** Navigation Multilingual Support Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Navigation components contained hardcoded English text instead of using the translation helper system
- Users visiting Russian (RU) and Chinese (ZH) pages saw English navigation buttons ("Markets", "Sectors", "Brand Spotlight", etc.)
- This broke the multilingual user experience and contradicted the site's BRICS+ international focus
- Two specific components needed fixing: dimensions navigation and insights category navigation

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None (leveraged existing translation infrastructure)
- Files modified: 
  - `_includes/components/dimensions/simple-dimensions-navigation.html` - Replaced hardcoded dimension names with translation helpers
  - `_includes/components/insights/simple-category-navigation.html` - Replaced hardcoded category names with translation helpers
- Files moved/deleted: Large cleanup of untracked files via `git clean -fd`

**Technical Decisions**
- **Used existing translation keys**: Instead of creating new translation keys, leveraged existing `nav.*` keys (markets, sectors, attributes, signals) and `insights.category_names.*` keys (brand-spotlight, founders-journey, etc.)
- **Fallback strategy**: Each translation helper includes English fallback text to ensure graceful degradation
- **Minimal changes approach**: Modified only the display text, preserved all existing navigation logic, styling, and URL structure
- **Alternative considered**: Creating new `insights.categories.*` keys with underscores, but abandoned due to YAML syntax issues and redundancy with existing category_names structure

**Code Changes**
- **Dimensions Navigation**: Replaced 4 hardcoded `<span>` elements with `{% include helpers/t.html key="nav.*" fallback="*" %}` calls
- **Insights Navigation**: Replaced 4 hardcoded `<span>` elements with `{% include helpers/t.html key="insights.category_names.*" fallback="*" %}` calls
- **Translation Integration**: Used existing translation helper system (`helpers/t.html`) that was already working for other components
- **Dependencies preserved**: No changes to CSS classes, navigation logic, or URL routing

**Testing Results**
- **Build verification**: `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` completed successfully
- **Translation key verification**: Confirmed all required keys exist in en.yml, ru.yml, zh.yml files
- **Code cleanup verification**: 
  ```bash
  grep -r 'Markets\|Sectors\|Attributes\|Signals' _includes/components/dimensions/simple-dimensions-navigation.html
  # Returns only translation helper calls, no hardcoded text
  ```
- **Server testing**: Jekyll server started successfully, pages load without errors
- **Git integration**: Clean commit created, working tree clean

**Future Considerations**
- **Performance**: Translation helpers add minimal overhead but could be optimized for high-traffic scenarios
- **Maintenance**: New navigation items should use translation helpers from the start
- **Consistency audit**: Other components may still have hardcoded text that should be migrated to translation helpers
- **Testing enhancement**: Could add automated tests to detect hardcoded text in navigation components
- **Documentation**: Update development guidelines to emphasize translation helper usage for all user-facing text
