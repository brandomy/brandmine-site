=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 26, 2025
**Task:** Latest Insights Section Responsive Optimization
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- The Latest Insights section on the home page had severe mobile usability issues with "Read More" CTAs being cut off on smaller devices
- Desktop cards displayed excessive whitespace (30-56px margins and fixed heights creating voids)
- Description content was cramped at 60px height, limiting readability
- The design was desktop-first, causing content loss on mobile viewports

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified: 
  - `/assets/css/pages/home/latest-insights.scss` - Complete mobile-first redesign with responsive optimizations
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Implemented mobile-first approach starting with 380px base height, scaling progressively
- Chose to use CSS variables for spacing (--space-3, --space-4) for consistency
- Replaced percentage-based image heights with aspect-ratio for better responsiveness
- Used -webkit-line-clamp for cross-browser text truncation
- Removed all fixed min-heights in favor of natural content-based sizing

**Code Changes**
- Mobile-first base styles:
  - Increased description height from 60px to 84px (mobile)
  - Progressive enhancement: 96px (tablet), 108px (desktop)
  - Changed line-clamp from 3 to 4-6 lines progressively
- Fixed CTA margins:
  - Removed `margin-top: auto` causing 30-56px dynamic spacing
  - Replaced with controlled spacing: var(--space-3) mobile, var(--space-4) tablet+
- Natural card sizing:
  - Removed all min-height declarations (380px, 420px, 460px, 480px)
  - Changed image from `height: 40%` to `aspect-ratio: 16/9`
  - Removed `flex: 1` from content areas preventing natural sizing

**Testing Results**
- Commands run: `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build`
- Build times: Consistently under 21 seconds (within acceptable range)
- Mobile viewports (375px, 414px): All content visible, CTAs accessible
- Tablet/Desktop (768px, 1200px+): Clean layouts without excessive whitespace
- Chrome DevTools: No purple void indicators, natural content flow

**Future Considerations**
- Consider implementing container queries for more granular responsive control
- Potential for CSS custom properties to make spacing adjustments site-wide
- May want to add min/max constraints if content varies significantly
- Monitor performance impact of multiple -webkit-line-clamp applications
- Consider lazy loading for insight images to improve page load times
