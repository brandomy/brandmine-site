=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Task:** Dimension Category Cards Testing Page Fixes and Variant Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Testing page had outdated component references (dimension-card vs dimension-category-card)
- Featured variant implementation was unclear and undocumented
- Hard-coded placeholder counts ("4 Categories") instead of actual dimension data
- Missing count display in standard variant created inconsistent user experience
- File naming didn't reflect actual component purpose (category cards vs individual dimension cards)
- Testing page lacked proper documentation of variant usage and visual differences

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-07-04-dimension-category-cards-testing-page-fixes.md` (this journal entry)
- Files modified:
  - `_includes/components/cards/dimension-category-card.html` (added count display to standard variant, improved HTML structure)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/dimension-category-card.scss` (added styling for standard variant count display)
  - `pages/en/test/dimension-category-cards-layout-testing.md` (updated all component references, documentation, and examples)
- Files moved/deleted:
  - Renamed: `pages/en/test/dimension-cards-layout-testing.md` â†’ `pages/en/test/dimension-category-cards-layout-testing.md`

**Technical Decisions**
- **Hard-coded counts over dynamic Jekyll collection filtering**: Chose reliable hard-coded values (16 Sectors, 13 Markets, 8 Attributes, 4 Signals) after dynamic collection filtering failed to work correctly with the dimension file structure
- **Added count display to both variants**: Extended count functionality from featured-only to both standard and featured variants for consistency and better user experience
- **Subtle styling for standard variant**: Used lighter, smaller text (`var(--text-xs)`, `var(--neutral-400)`) for standard variant counts vs prominent styling for featured variant
- **Comprehensive component reference update**: Updated all CSS selectors, JavaScript selectors, and documentation to reflect correct component naming
- **File rename for semantic accuracy**: Renamed testing page to match actual component purpose (category navigation cards vs individual dimension items)

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created: None (enhanced existing component)
- Integration points modified:
  - Added `dimension-category-card__title-section` wrapper to standard variant for consistent structure with featured variant
  - Added `dimension-category-card__count--standard` modifier class for variant-specific styling
  - Updated all CSS debugging selectors in testing page to use correct component class names
  - Updated JavaScript debugging functions to target correct element selectors
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Testing page now properly reflects actual component implementation
  - Homepage dimension cards now show consistent count information in both discovery grid and featured sections
  - CSS methodology maintained with proper BEM naming conventions

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - Successful build completion (6.505 seconds)
  - Multiple build tests during implementation - All successful
  - File rename operations - No broken links or references
- What worked as expected:
  - Both standard and featured variants display appropriate count styling
  - Component references updated throughout testing page without errors
  - Hard-coded counts display reliably in both variant types
  - File rename completed with proper permalink updates
  - Testing page provides clear documentation of variant differences
- Any issues discovered:
  - Initial dynamic collection filtering approach failed due to Jekyll collection structure mismatch
  - Resolved by implementing reliable hard-coded counts based on actual file count analysis

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Consider implementing proper dynamic count system if Jekyll collection structure changes
  - Monitor if dimension counts change significantly and update hard-coded values
  - Evaluate if count display adds value in all usage contexts or should be configurable
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Update any other testing pages that reference old component names
  - Consider adding count display configuration option to component defaults
  - Verify homepage dimension section displays correctly with new count functionality
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Hard-coded counts will need manual updates when dimension content changes
  - Testing page serves as definitive documentation for component usage patterns
  - Both variants now have consistent feature parity for count display
  - CSS debugging tools in testing page updated to work with correct component structure
