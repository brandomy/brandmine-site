**Date:** 2025-07-10
**Task:** Legacy Dimension Category Cleanup
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Legacy dimension category system had 5 separate layout files and include directories creating code duplication and maintenance overhead
- CSS panel conflicts between `.panel--category-hero` used by both insights and dimensions causing styling inconsistencies
- Hard-coded navigation in layouts prevented proper section ordering control
- Missing impact sections in dimensions categories caused CTA styling inconsistencies (black text instead of white)
- Redundant page section configurations for individual category types instead of unified approach

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_includes/pages/dimensions-category/dimensions-navigation.html` - Navigation section for category pages
  - `_includes/pages/dimensions-category/impact.html` - Impact section with category-specific content
- Files modified:
  - `assets/css/layout/panels/_panel-types.scss` - Added `.panel--dimensions-category-hero` with dimension-specific gradients
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Updated dimensions-category configuration, removed redundant individual configs
  - `_layouts/dimensions-category.html` - Removed hard-coded navigation, moved to page sections control
- Files moved/deleted:
  - Removed 5 layout files: `attributes-category.html`, `markets-category.html`, `sectors-category.html`, `signals-category.html`, `dimension-category.html`
  - Removed 5 include directories: `_includes/pages/attributes-category/`, `_includes/pages/markets-category/`, `_includes/pages/sectors-category/`, `_includes/pages/signals-category/`, `_includes/pages/discover/`
  - Removed 3 duplicate directories: `assets/css/pages/dimension/`, `assets/js/pages/dimension/`, `_includes/pages/dimension/`

**Technical Decisions**
- **CSS Separation Strategy**: Created separate `.panel--dimensions-category-hero` instead of sharing `.panel--category-hero` to avoid future conflicts between insights and dimensions
- **Page Sections Approach**: Moved navigation control from hard-coded layout to configurable page sections for better maintainability
- **Unified Configuration**: Consolidated 4 individual category configurations into single `dimensions-category` configuration using dynamic category detection
- **Impact Section Addition**: Added impact sections to match insights-category structure for consistent styling
- **Phased Implementation**: Used 7-phase approach with verification checkpoints to ensure safe removal of legacy code

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - Dimensions navigation component for category pages with active state detection
  - Impact section component with category-specific messaging using Liquid case statements
- Integration points modified:
  - Page sections helper now properly handles dimensions-category navigation ordering
  - CSS panel system now has clear separation between insights and dimensions styling
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - All dimension category pages now use unified layout and styling system
  - Navigation ordering now follows configurable pattern: breadcrumbs → dimensions-navigation → hero → content → impact → contact-cta

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` - Build time improved from 12.1s to 6.0s
  - URL testing for all dimension tiers: Discovery → Category → Profile
  - Individual category testing: Markets, Sectors, Attributes, Signals
- What worked as expected:
  - All dimension category pages render correctly with proper sky blue/olive/orange/indigo gradients
  - Navigation appears in correct order after breadcrumbs
  - CTA sections now have white text on teal background matching insights pages
  - Impact sections provide contextual information for each dimension type
- Any issues discovered:
  - Initial build cache issue required clean rebuild to apply new panel classes
  - Navigation ordering required creation of new section includes

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Impact section content could be moved to data files for easier translation management
  - Category-specific hero images could be added to enhance visual differentiation
  - Navigation component could be further optimized for mobile responsiveness
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Review and optimize dimension profile pages for consistency
  - Consider similar cleanup for other category systems (brands, founders)
  - Update documentation to reflect new unified architecture
- Maintenance considerations:
  - New dimension types (if ever added) only need updates to unified configuration
  - CSS changes only need to be made in single location
  - Navigation changes controlled through page sections configuration
