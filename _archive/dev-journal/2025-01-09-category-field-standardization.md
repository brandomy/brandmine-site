=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Task:** Category Field Standardization (`insight_type` & `dimension_type` â†’ `category`)
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Inconsistent field naming across insight and dimension category pages created confusion and maintenance overhead
- Insight category pages used `insight_type` while dimension category pages used `dimension_type` 
- Throughout the UI and documentation, both were referred to as "categories", creating semantic misalignment
- This inconsistency would complicate the planned universal category-hero panel implementation
- The mixed naming convention made the codebase harder to understand and maintain

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 1 (this journal entry)
- Files modified: 55 total across 5 phases
  - Phase 1: 3 layout/config files (added backward compatibility)
  - Phase 2: 27 markdown category pages (field name changes)
  - Phase 3: 6 component template files (unified field usage)
  - Phase 4: 3 data/JavaScript files (JSON export updates)
  - Phase 5: All files (cleanup of backward compatibility)
- Files moved/deleted: None
- Git branch: `standardize-category-fields` with 5 commits tracking each phase

**Technical Decisions**
- **Phased Implementation**: Used 5-phase approach with backward compatibility to ensure zero downtime
- **Unified Field Name**: Chose `category` as it aligns with how these concepts are referenced throughout the UI
- **Backward Compatibility**: Temporarily supported both old and new field names using Liquid defaults (`page.category | default: page.insight_type`)
- **Batch Updates**: Used sed for efficient bulk updates of markdown files
- **Conservative Testing**: Built and verified after each phase before proceeding
- **URL Preservation**: Ensured zero impact on public URLs or user-facing functionality

**Code Changes**
- **Layout Files**: Updated `_layouts/insights-category.html` and `_layouts/dimensions-category.html` to use unified field
- **Component Templates**: Modified 6 includes to use `page.category` consistently across insights and dimensions
- **Data Exports**: Updated `search.json`, `dimensions.json`, and JavaScript to use `category` field
- **Configuration**: Updated `_data/page_sections.yml` to reference new field structure
- **Front Matter**: Standardized 27 category pages to use `category` field instead of type-specific fields

**Testing Results**
- **Build Tests**: `bundle exec jekyll build` successful after each phase (5 total builds)
- **Clean Build**: `bundle exec jekyll clean && bundle exec jekyll build` successful for final verification
- **Field Reference Check**: Confirmed no remaining `insight_type` or `dimension_type` references in page front matter
- **URL Verification**: All category page URLs unchanged (insights: `/insights/categories/`, dimensions: `/discover/`)
- **Functionality Tests**: Search, navigation, and filtering all working correctly
- **Visual Verification**: All pages render identically to pre-implementation state

**Future Considerations**
- **Universal Hero Panel**: This standardization enables the planned common category-hero panel that can reliably use `page.category` across all category types
- **Component Simplification**: Future components can use single field reference instead of conditional logic
- **Documentation Updates**: Technical documentation should be updated to reflect the unified field naming
- **Translation Integration**: Category field now aligns with translation key structures for better i18n support
- **Search Enhancement**: Unified field simplifies search index structure and client-side filtering logic
- **Maintenance**: Future category pages only need to remember one field name (`category`) regardless of type
