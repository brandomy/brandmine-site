=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 25, 2025
**Task:** Complete Cleanup of Old Featured Case Studies Section
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Remove all traces of the old "featured-case-studies" section now that the new "case-studies" section is working perfectly
- Eliminate code duplication and potential conflicts between old and new implementations
- Clean up orphaned component configurations and SCSS imports that were no longer functional
- Ensure homepage only displays the production-ready carousel implementation
- Maintain clean codebase with no dead code or unused references

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 0 (cleanup task)
- Files modified: 7 configuration and manifest files
- Files moved/deleted: 6 component files completely removed

**Technical Decisions**
- **Complete removal approach**: Chose to completely delete old files rather than deprecation to eliminate confusion and maintenance burden
- **Systematic verification**: Used comprehensive search commands to ensure no orphaned references remained
- **Configuration cleanup**: Removed not just files but also their imports, translations, and component defaults
- **Build validation**: Ensured site continues to build and function correctly after cleanup
- **Preserve working implementation**: Maintained exact functionality of new case-studies section

**Code Changes**
- **Files completely removed:**
  - `_includes/pages/home/featured-case-studies.html` - Old section template
  - `_includes/components/carousels/featured-case-studies-carousel.html` - Old carousel component
  - `_includes/components/cards/case-study-card.html` - Complex/incomplete card component
  - `_includes/components/cards/case-study-card.html.backup-strategic` - Backup file
  - `assets/css/components/carousels/featured-case-studies-carousel.scss` - Old carousel styles
  - `assets/css/components/cards/case-study-card.scss` - Old card styles

- **Configuration files updated:**
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Removed `featured-case-studies` from home sections and panel mappings
  - `_data/translations/{en,ru,zh}.yml` - Removed old `featured_case_studies` translation keys
  - `_data/component_defaults.yml` - Removed `featured-case-studies-carousel` and `case-study-card` configs

- **SCSS manifest cleanup:**
  - `assets/css/manifest/components.scss` - Removed featured-case-studies-carousel import
  - `assets/css/components/cards/_index.scss` - Removed case-study-card import
  - `assets/css/components/case-studies/_index.scss` - Cleaned up orphaned comment

**Testing Results**
- **Verification commands run:**
  ```bash
  # File existence checks
  find _includes -name "*featured-case-studies*"     # Result: none found
  find _includes -name "*case-study-card*"           # Result: none found
  find assets -name "*featured-case-studies*"       # Result: none found
  find assets -name "*case-study-card*"             # Result: none found
  
  # Configuration reference checks
  grep -r "featured-case-studies" _data/             # Result: none found
  grep -r "case-study-card" _data/                   # Result: none found
  
  # Build and functionality tests
  bundle exec jekyll build                           # Result: successful (21.4s)
  curl http://localhost:4000/en/ | grep -c "case-studies"        # Result: 23 occurrences
  curl http://localhost:4000/en/ | grep -c "featured-case-studies" # Result: 0 occurrences
  ```

- **What worked as expected:**
  - All old files and references completely removed
  - Homepage continues to build without errors
  - Only new case-studies section appears on homepage
  - Carousel functionality remains identical to working implementation
  - No broken imports or missing dependencies

- **Issues discovered:**
  - Found orphaned SCSS imports in manifest files that needed manual cleanup
  - Component defaults contained unused configurations that were cluttering the file
  - Some formatting cleanup needed after removing configuration blocks

**Future Considerations**
- **Maintenance benefits:**
  - Codebase is now cleaner with single source of truth for case studies display
  - No confusion between old and new implementations for future developers
  - Reduced build complexity with fewer unused imports

- **Related tasks completed:**
  - All translation files cleaned across three languages
  - SCSS manifest dependencies properly updated
  - Component configuration files streamlined

- **Development practices:**
  - This cleanup demonstrates importance of removing deprecated code promptly
  - Systematic verification approach ensures complete removal
  - Future implementations should consider cleanup phase as part of the development cycle

- **Documentation notes:**
  - Only references to old files now exist in log files and archive backups (expected)
  - New case-studies implementation is now the sole carousel solution
  - Any future case study display modifications should build on the current working implementation
