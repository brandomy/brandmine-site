**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Task:** Location Icon Removal from Brand Cards
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brand cards displayed location with a Unicode pin emoji (üìç) that looked poor and unprofessional
- The emoji created unwanted spacing/indentation issues, causing misalignment between "Founded" and location text
- FontAwesome icons (fa-map-marker-alt) were referenced but not loaded, creating invisible spacing

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: None
- Files modified:
  - `_includes/components/helpers/location-display.html` - Removed icon logic and simplified to text-only
  - `_includes/components/cards/featured-founder-card.html` - Removed FontAwesome icon element
  - `assets/css/components/cards/brand-card.scss` - Removed .location__icon styling and simplified flex container
  - `assets/css/components/cards/founder-card.scss` - Removed two .location__icon style blocks
  - `assets/css/components/cards/featured-founder-card.scss` - Removed .location__icon styling
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- Chose complete removal over fixing icon display because:
  - FontAwesome wasn't loaded site-wide (would add unnecessary weight)
  - Unicode emoji looked unprofessional
  - Clean text-only approach aligns with minimalist design
- Simplified flex container to inline display since no icon alignment needed
- Maintained backwards compatibility by keeping the same HTML structure

**Code Changes**
- location-display.html simplified from:
  ```liquid
  {% assign show_icon = include.icon | default: true %}
  <span class="{{ include.class | default: 'location' }}">
    {% if show_icon %}
      <span class="location__icon" aria-hidden="true">üìç</span>
    {% endif %}
    <span class="location__text">...</span>
  </span>
  ```
  To clean single-line output:
  ```liquid
  <span class="{{ include.class | default: 'location' }}">{% if include.city %}{{ include.city }}{% if include.country %}, {% endif %}{% endif %}{% if include.country %}{% include components/helpers/country-name.html code=include.country lang=include.lang %}{% endif %}</span>
  ```
- Removed all CSS rules for .location__icon across three card stylesheets
- Changed .brand-card__location .location from flex to inline display

**Testing Results**
- Commands run: `bundle exec jekyll build` (successful, 16.92 seconds)
- Verified test page at `/test/brand-cards-layout-testing.html`
- Confirmed no icon references remain in homepage HTML
- "Founded" and location text now align perfectly in brand cards
- No broken styling or layout issues detected

**Future Considerations**
- If icons are needed in future, consider using inline SVGs instead of icon fonts
- The simplified location-display.html could be further optimized by removing the wrapper span
- May want to update documentation to reflect that the `icon` parameter is no longer used
- Consider adding visual regression tests for card layouts
