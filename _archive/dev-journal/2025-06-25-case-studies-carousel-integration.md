=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 25, 2025
**Task:** Case Studies Carousel Integration and Data Structure Refactoring
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Need to integrate successful carousel implementation from test page to production homepage
- Chinese card titles were duplicating due to punctuation differences (full-width colon `：` vs ASCII colon `:`)
- Inconsistent field naming between case studies data (`slug`, `client`) and site-wide standards (`ref`, `brand`)
- Localization issues with hardcoded English dimension tags and CTA button text
- Image paths needed to be updated to match new naming conventions

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 4 new independent files for homepage carousel integration
- Files modified: 9 existing files updated for field changes and localization
- Files moved/deleted: 4 image folders renamed, ~16 image files renamed with new prefixes

**Technical Decisions**
- **Field standardization**: Changed `slug` to `ref` with country codes (`cn-perfect-diary`) to match site-wide `country-brandslug` pattern
- **Semantic clarity**: Changed `client` to `brand` since these are industry case studies, not client work
- **Title display logic**: Replaced colon-splitting with dedicated `brand` + `description` fields to avoid cross-language punctuation issues
- **Independent assets**: Created separate SCSS/JS files instead of reusing existing carousel assets to avoid conflicts
- **Manifest integration**: Integrated SCSS through home page manifest system rather than standalone CSS file

**Code Changes**
- **New components created:**
  - `_includes/pages/home/case-studies.html` - Production carousel with localization
  - `assets/css/pages/home/case-studies-section.scss` - Independent carousel styles
  - `assets/js/pages/home/case-studies-section.js` - Dynamic carousel functionality
  - `assets/css/pages/home/case-studies-section.css` - Jekyll compilation wrapper

- **Integration points modified:**
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Added new `case-studies` section after `featured-case-studies`
  - `_layouts/home.html` - Added JavaScript reference, removed standalone CSS link
  - `assets/css/pages/home/_index.scss` - Added SCSS import to manifest chain
  - `_data/translations/{en,ru,zh}.yml` - Added translation keys for new section

- **Dependencies affected:**
  - All case study card components updated to use new field names
  - Image processing paths need updating for new folder structure
  - Test pages updated to maintain functionality

**Testing Results**
- **Commands run:**
  ```bash
  bundle exec jekyll build  # Successful build (20.8s)
  curl http://localhost:4000/{en,ru,zh}/  # All languages rendering correctly
  ```

- **What worked as expected:**
  - Carousel functionality identical to test implementation
  - Proper localization of dimension tags using `helpers/dimension-name.html`
  - CTA button text correctly shows "Read Full Story"/"Читать полную историю"/"阅读完整故事"
  - Chinese cards now display clean brand names without duplication
  - Both old and new carousel sections visible for comparison

- **Issues discovered:**
  - Initial build failed due to missing country code updates in Chinese data section (fixed)
  - CSS compilation required Jekyll wrapper file (resolved with manifest integration)

**Future Considerations**
- **Potential improvements:**
  - Remove old `featured-case-studies` section once new carousel is confirmed working
  - Consider creating a helper for case study image path generation
  - Evaluate if metrics localization is needed beyond current label translations

- **Related tasks:**
  - Update image processing scripts to handle new `ref` naming convention
  - Verify all case study permalinks still work with folder renames
  - Consider standardizing other data files to use `ref` instead of `slug`

- **Maintenance considerations:**
  - New case studies must use `ref` with country codes, not `slug`
  - Image assets must be placed in `{country-code}-{brand-slug}/` folders
  - Component updates should reference `case_study.brand` and `case_study.ref`
  - Translation updates must maintain consistency across all three language files
