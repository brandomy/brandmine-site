=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** January 29, 2025
**Task:** Brand Card Cleanup and Image Investigation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brand cards test page was showing empty gray placeholders instead of actual brand content
- Legacy brand card components were causing redundancy and maintenance issues
- Need for comprehensive deployment reference for brand cards across the site
- Image display investigation was required to ensure proper functionality
- Test page sections needed cleanup and better organization

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: `_archive/dev-journal-2025-01-29-brand-card-cleanup.md` (this journal entry)
- Files modified: 
  - `_includes/components/helpers/card-header.html` (fixed missing parameter assignment)
  - `_includes/pages/home/featured-brands.html` (migrated to modern brand-card.html with variant)
  - `_includes/pages/home/featured-brands-simplified.html` (migrated to standard brand-card.html)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/_index.scss` (commented out removed imports)
  - `pages/en/test/brand-cards-layout-testing.md` (added comparison section and deployment reference)
- Files moved/deleted: 
  - `_includes/components/cards/simplified-brand-card.html` (deleted)
  - `_includes/components/cards/featured-brand-card.html` (deleted)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/simplified-brand-card.scss` (deleted)
  - `assets/css/components/cards/featured-brand-card.scss` (deleted)

**Technical Decisions**
- Fixed empty gray placeholders by adding missing `{% assign brand = include.brand %}` in card-header.html
- Migrated homepage components to use brand-card.html with variants before deleting legacy files to prevent breakage
- Chose to remove legacy components entirely rather than maintain parallel systems
- Added comprehensive deployment reference section to test page for developer guidance
- Used placeholder descriptions instead of actual complex components that were causing build issues

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created: None (focused on cleanup and migration)
- Integration points modified: Homepage featured brand sections now use modern card system
- Dependencies or relationships affected: Removed 4 legacy files and updated their CSS imports

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes: Manual testing via Jekyll development server
- What worked as expected: 
  - Brand cards now display properly with images and content instead of gray placeholders
  - Homepage brand sections migrated successfully to modern components
  - CSS builds without import errors after component removal
  - Test page serves as comprehensive deployment reference
- Issues discovered: Images ARE working correctly - investigation confirmed responsive srcset system functioning properly

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations: Consider consolidating hero-brand-card.html into variant system
- Related tasks that might be needed: Complete migration of remaining legacy card usage across site
- Maintenance considerations: Single brand-card.html component with variants simplifies maintenance and reduces code duplication
