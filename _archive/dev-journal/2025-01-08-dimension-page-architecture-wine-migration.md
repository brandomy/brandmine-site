=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Task:** Dimension Page Architecture & Wine Dimension Image Migration
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Dimension pages were not using the collection-image component, instead using direct path logic
- Image structure for dimensions was inconsistent with other collections (flat vs subdirectory)
- Missing hero-card styling for dimension pages (using subtle panel instead)
- Brand section headings lacked clarity (missing "Brands" text)
- Missing required section files (content.html, cta.html) causing build failures

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created:
  - `_includes/pages/dimension/content.html` - Main dimension content section
  - `_includes/pages/dimension/cta.html` - Call-to-action section
  - `assets/images/dimensions/sectors/wine/` - New subdirectory structure
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-01-08-dimension-page-architecture-wine-migration.md` - This journal entry
  
- Files modified:
  - `_includes/pages/dimension/hero.html` - Updated to use collection-image component with context-aware naming
  - `_includes/pages/dimension/all-brands.html` - Added "Brands" to heading
  - `_includes/pages/dimension/featured-brands.html` - Added "Brands" to heading
  - `_data/page_sections.yml` - Changed dimension hero from panel--hero-subtle to panel--hero-card
  - `assets/css/pages/dimension/_index.scss` - Added hero-card import
  
- Files moved/deleted:
  - `assets/images/dimensions/sectors/wine-*.jpg` → `assets/images/dimensions/sectors/wine/wine-hero-vineyard-*.jpg`
  - `assets/images/dimensions/sectors/originals/wine.jpg` → `assets/images/dimensions/sectors/wine/originals/hero-vineyard.jpg`

**Technical Decisions**
- Key choices made during implementation:
  - **Option B (Restructure)** chosen over modifying collection-image component or hybrid approach
  - Context-aware naming implemented (wine-hero-vineyard vs generic wine-hero)
  - Category pluralization logic added (sector → sectors) to match directory structure
  - Used existing hero-card.scss styling to match insight-article pattern
  
- Rationale for approach taken:
  - Consistency with established brand/insight collection patterns
  - Future-proofing for multiple image purposes (hero, logo, icon)
  - Seamless integration with existing collection-image component
  - Minimal disruption to existing functionality
  
- Alternative approaches considered:
  - Option A: Modify collection-image to handle flat structure (rejected - adds complexity)
  - Option C: Hybrid approach with backward compatibility (rejected - maintains inconsistency)

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created:
  - Category pluralization logic: `{% assign category_plural = page.category | append: "s" %}`
  - Context-aware image naming with `name="vineyard"` parameter
  
- Integration points modified:
  - Collection-image component now handles dimensions collection
  - Hero styling switched from subtle panel to card layout
  - Meta content added showing brand count (hardcoded initially)
  
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Dimension pages now depend on standard collection-image structure
  - CSS requires hero-card.scss import for proper styling
  - Page sections configuration drives section rendering

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  ```bash
  bundle exec jekyll build --incremental
  find assets/images/dimensions/sectors/wine -type f | sort
  grep -n "heading_default" _includes/pages/dimension/*.html
  ```
  
- What worked as expected:
  - Build completes successfully (7-11 seconds)
  - Collection-image component resolves paths correctly
  - Hero card styling displays properly
  - Brand section headings include "Brands" text
  - Responsive images load with proper srcset
  
- Issues discovered:
  - Initial mismatch between page.category ("sector") and directory ("sectors")
  - Missing content.html and cta.html sections required by page_sections.yml
  - Both issues resolved during implementation

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Migrate remaining dimensions (natural-beauty, russia, founder-led, etc.)
  - Implement dynamic brand count from actual filtered data
  - Add front matter image configuration for alt text and context names
  - Create migration script for batch processing all dimensions
  
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Update image processing scripts to handle new subdirectory structure
  - Document dimension image naming conventions in technical standards
  - Add dimension-specific context names (kremlin for russia, products for natural-beauty)
  - Implement fallback logic for dimensions without custom image names
  
- Maintenance considerations:
  - New dimensions must follow subdirectory structure
  - Image processing pipeline needs to create proper directory hierarchy
  - Category pluralization logic must be maintained in hero component
  - Collection-image component compatibility must be preserved
