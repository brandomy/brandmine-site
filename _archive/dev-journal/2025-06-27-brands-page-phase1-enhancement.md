=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** June 27, 2025
**Task:** Brands Page Phase 1 Enhancement - Universal Card Migration & Carousel Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Brands page was using legacy card components (`hero-brand-card.html`, `brand-card.html`) instead of the universal card system proven successful on homepage
- Featured and latest brands sections used static CSS grids instead of engaging interactive carousels
- Inconsistent component architecture across site prevented efficient maintenance and pattern replication
- Mobile experience lacked the premium touch interactions established in homepage patterns

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 2
  - `assets/js/pages/brands/featured-brands-carousel.js` - Carousel functionality adapted from homepage patterns
  - `_includes/components/cards/founder-test-card.html` - Temporary placeholder to resolve build errors
- Files modified: 8
  - `_includes/pages/brands/featured-brands.html` - Migrated to universal carousel with universal-card
  - `_includes/pages/brands/latest-brands.html` - Applied Latest Insights 2x2 grid pattern with universal-card
  - `assets/css/pages/brands/featured-brands.scss` - Universal carousel CSS implementation
  - `assets/css/pages/brands/latest-brands.scss` - 2x2 grid responsive pattern
  - `_layouts/brands.html` - Added carousel JavaScript integration
  - `_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel.html` - Fixed broken component references
  - `_includes/pages/founders/founders-carousel-dual.html` - Fixed broken component references
  - `assets/css/components/cards/_index.scss` - Removed broken tagged-insight-card import
- Files moved/deleted: 0 (cleanup deferred to Phase 2)

**Technical Decisions**
- **Universal Card Migration**: Chose to migrate both featured and latest brands sections to universal-card system for consistency with homepage architecture
- **Pattern Replication**: Applied proven homepage patterns (universal carousel for featured, 2x2 grid for latest) rather than creating new approaches
- **JavaScript Architecture**: Adapted existing homepage carousel JavaScript rather than building from scratch, ensuring consistent behavior
- **CSS Enhancement**: Maintained existing design token usage while adding universal carousel patterns
- **Phased Approach**: Limited scope to core foundation migration, deferring founder integration and advanced cleanup to Phase 2

**Code Changes**
- New components/helpers created: Custom carousel JavaScript for brands page context
- Integration points modified: 
  - Featured brands section now uses universal carousel with dot navigation
  - Latest brands section uses Latest Insights responsive grid pattern
  - Brands layout includes carousel JavaScript for enhanced interactivity
- Dependencies or relationships affected:
  - Universal card system now used across homepage and brands page
  - Carousel patterns consistent between homepage and brands page
  - Fixed circular component references in founders carousel files

**Testing Results**
- Commands run to verify changes:
  ```bash
  grep -r "universal-card" _includes/pages/brands/ | wc -l  # Result: 5 references
  grep -r "brand-card" _includes/pages/brands/ | wc -l     # Result: 2 references (brands-grid only)
  time JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build      # Build time: ~10.3s (+1.6s)
  ```
- What worked as expected:
  - Universal card migration successful for featured and latest brands sections
  - Carousel functionality operational with touch interactions
  - 2x2 grid responsive behavior matches homepage Latest Insights pattern
  - Build process stabilized after fixing broken component references
- Any issues discovered:
  - Build errors from missing founder-test-card.html (resolved with placeholder)
  - Legacy CSS imports needed commenting out to prevent build failures
  - Build time increase of 1.6 seconds acceptable for foundation changes

**Future Considerations**
- Potential improvements or optimizations:
  - Remove temporary founder-test-card.html placeholder once CLAUDE.md references are cleaned
  - Consolidate remaining brand-card usage in brands-grid.html to complete universal card migration
  - Optimize carousel JavaScript for better performance on slower devices
  - Add founder integration features to enhance brand storytelling
- Related tasks that might be needed:
  - Phase 2: Founder spotlight section addition to brands page
  - Phase 2: Mobile touch interaction optimization
  - Phase 2: Component cleanup (remove legacy brand card variants)
  - Phase 3: Apply patterns to other page types (founders, discovery)
- Maintenance considerations:
  - Monitor build time impact as more sections are enhanced
  - Ensure universal card configurations support all brand display variants
  - Test carousel functionality across all supported browsers and devices
  - Maintain consistency between homepage and brands page carousel behavior
