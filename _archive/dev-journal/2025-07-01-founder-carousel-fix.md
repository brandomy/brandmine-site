=== DEV JOURNAL ENTRY ===

**Date:** July 1, 2025
**Task:** Founder Cards Carousel Functionality Fix
**Status:** Completed

**Problem Statement**
- Founder cards in test page carousels were displaying as 4-column grid layout instead of single-card carousel slides
- Navigation dots were non-functional due to JavaScript selector mismatches
- Test page carousels used different `data-component-type` values than what the CSS and JavaScript were configured to handle
- Homepage founder carousel worked correctly, but test page implementation diverged from working patterns

**Implementation Summary**
- Files created: 
  - `_archive/dev-journal/2025-07-01-founder-carousel-fix.md` (this journal entry)
- Files modified:
  - `assets/css/components/layout/carousel.scss` (added CSS rules for test component types)
- Files moved/deleted: None

**Technical Decisions**
- **Approach Chosen**: Added missing CSS rules for test page component types rather than restructuring test page
- **Rationale**: Quick fix that maintains existing test page structure while providing proper carousel behavior
- **Alternative Approaches Considered**:
  1. Restructure test page to use `data-component-type="founder-focus"` (would require changing HTML structure)
  2. Create new universal carousel component integration (more complex, longer term solution)
  3. Modify JavaScript selectors to target test component types (would affect multiple files)

**Code Changes**
- **New CSS Rules Added**: Specific carousel behavior for `founder-cards-test`, `founder-featured-test`, and `founder-focus-test` component types
- **Integration Points**: Added rules mirror the working `founder-focus` implementation with:
  - `flex: 0 0 100%` for mobile (single card per view)
  - `flex: 0 0 900px` for desktop (fixed width for consistent display)
  - `scroll-snap-align: center` for smooth navigation
  - Responsive gap adjustments via `@include carousel-responsive-gaps()`
- **Dependencies Affected**: Test page carousels now inherit proper carousel behavior from layout component

**Testing Results**
- **Build Command**: `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` completed successfully in 14.623 seconds
- **Expected Behavior**: Test page carousels should now display single cards per slide with proper flex layout
- **CSS Validation**: New rules follow same pattern as working homepage implementation
- **No Breaking Changes**: Addition only, no existing functionality affected

**Future Considerations**
- **Potential Improvements**: 
  - Standardize all founder carousels to use universal component pattern
  - Consolidate test component types to reduce CSS duplication
  - Add proper navigation dot generation for test carousels
- **Related Tasks**: 
  - Complete founder card reorganization from 3+ components to 2 components
  - Implement universal carousel component for all test pages
  - Add automated testing for carousel functionality
- **Maintenance Considerations**:
  - Monitor test page carousel behavior to ensure fix is working as expected
  - Consider removing custom JavaScript in test page in favor of universal carousel initialization
  - Document component type naming conventions to prevent future selector mismatches
