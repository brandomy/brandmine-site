  Layout: case-study.html
  Purpose: Renders individual case study pages with business context and metrics
  Used By: pages/case-studies/ static pages
  Front Matter Required: Standard case study metadata (client, industry, duration, metrics)
  Sections Rendered: Data-driven via page_sections.yml (case-study)

  Architecture Notes:

  - Supports markdown content rendering in designated content sections
  - Maintains mobile-first responsive design patterns
