The market for specialty cheeses has grown to approximately $1.2 billion, with an impressive 35% annual growth rate.\n\nThe sector now includes over 350 small-batch creameries producing everything from soft bloomy-rind cheeses to alpine-style mountain cheeses and aged hard varieties. Many producers have studied European cheesemaking techniques in France, Italy, and Switzerland, adapting these approaches to work with local milk and microbiological conditions.\n\nThis artisanal cheese renaissance has contributed to broader culinary tourism development, with cheese routes and farm experiences becoming increasingly popular. The sector benefits from growing consumer interest in quality and provenance, with many Russians now able to distinguish and appreciate the subtleties of artisanal production."
