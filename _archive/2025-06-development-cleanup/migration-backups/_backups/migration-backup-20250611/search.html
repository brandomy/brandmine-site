================================================================================

Purpose:
Provides a placeholder search interface to track user search interest for 
founders. This component uses the search-placeholder component to provide a 
non-functional search box that captures user intent for analytics.

Context:
- Placeholder implementation for MVP
- Tracks search attempts for future feature development
- Provides visual consistency with functional search interfaces

Parameters:
- None (configuration is hardcoded for founders context)

Dependencies:
- Component: components/search/search-placeholder.html
- Data: site.data.translations for text labels

Component Configuration:
- Title: "Search Founders"
- Placeholder: "Search by founder name, country, sector, or expertise..."
- ID: "founders-search"
- Content Type: "founders"
- Hint: "Discover founders by location, expertise, or business story"

Notes:
- This is a placeholder that doesn't perform actual searches
- Used to gauge user interest in founder search functionality
- Will be replaced with functional search in future iterations
