## üéØ STRATEGIC ACHIEVEMENTS

### Component Extraction Success ‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH**
**Problem Solved**: After 3+ hours of CSS debugging, achieved working component extraction using pragmatic approach
**Solution**: Simple BEM component with inline styles bypasses CSS conflicts entirely
**Architecture**: Maintains "Logic Light" principles while ensuring functionality
**Reusability**: Atomic component now works across all card variants consistently

**Key Breakthrough**:
```
Previous: Complex CSS-based component with conflicts
Current: Simple inline-styled component with guaranteed function
