## üîÑ CURRENT PRIORITY: Universal Carousel Implementation

### Problem Identified
**Issue:** Brands/Founders pages featured sections show different styling than homepage carousels
**Root Cause:** Universal carousel component used different architecture instead of copying working homepage patterns
**Impact:** Rich homepage carousel experience not replicated on other pages

### Solution Strategy
**Approach:** Copy exact homepage carousel patterns with minimal parameterization
**Reference Standards:** Featured Brands, Founder Focus, Case Studies (homepage)
**Success Criteria:** Pixel-perfect identical output across all pages

### Implementation Rules Established
- ‚úÖ Use identical CSS classes as homepage (`.universal-carousel`)
- ‚úÖ Use direct card includes (no helper indirection)
- ‚úÖ Use identical JavaScript targeting patterns
- ‚úÖ Only parameterize content source (`site.brands` vs `site.founders`)
- ‚ùå No new CSS class naming schemes
- ‚ùå No helper abstraction layers
- ‚ùå No architectural innovations

## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Universal Carousel Creation**: Copy working homepage patterns exactly
