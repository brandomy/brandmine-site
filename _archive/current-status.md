## 🎯 STRATEGIC DECISIONS ESTABLISHED

### Hybrid Card Architecture Pattern ✅
**Principle**: Separate files for complex differences, variants for sizing modifications

**Implementation**:
```
Brand Cards: brand-card.html (variants: standard, featured, mini)
Founder Cards: founder-card.html + founder-card-featured.html + founder-card.html variant="mini"
Insight Cards: TARGET - insight-card.html (variants: standard, featured, mini)
```

### Mobile-First Sizing Strategy ✅
**Atomic Card Size**: 345px width (fits iPhone SE with margins)
**Responsive Strategy**: Option B - min-width responsive enhancement
**Featured Cards**: 345px mobile base → 480px+ desktop enhancement

### CSS Architecture Standards ✅
**Component Responsibility**: Typography, spacing, colors, internal layout
**Page/Layout Responsibility**: Grid positioning, margins, page-level responsive behavior
**Enforcement**: 100% compliance achieved across all homepage cards
