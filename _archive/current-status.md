# Brandmine Current Status
**Last Updated**: July 9, 2025 - Hero Panel BEM Compliance & Architecture Planning
**Current Phase**: Hero System BEM Migration & 3-Layer Architecture Verification
**Build Performance**: 4.9s ‚úÖ (maintained through BEM compliance improvements)
**Environment**: Production-Ready (Jekyll 3.9.5 + GitHub Pages)

---

## üèÜ MAJOR BEM COMPLIANCE ACHIEVEMENT

### Panel System BEM Migration COMPLETE ‚úÖ **PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTURE**
- **94% BEM compliance achieved**: 17 of 18 critical violations resolved in CSS layer
- **Professional CSS architecture**: Hero panels, color panels, utility modifiers all BEM-compliant
- **Documentation complete**: Comprehensive BEM guidelines established in technical standards
- **Template migration ready**: CSS foundation prepared for template BEM adoption

### BEM Implementation Results ‚úÖ **SOLID FOUNDATION**
- **CSS layer complete**: All panel types follow proper BEM methodology
- **Element modifiers available**: 28 new BEM-compliant classes for hero and color panels
- **Naming consistency**: Clear, logical BEM patterns across all panel types
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy classes maintained during transition period

### Panel Architecture Maturity ‚úÖ **ENTERPRISE-READY**
- **Complete panel toolkit**: 8 color panels + 6 hero variants + utility modifiers
- **Naming logic resolved**: panel--orange-soft (accurate) vs panel--amber-soft (eliminated)
- **Color system integration**: Panels properly align with design token architecture
- **Performance maintained**: 4.9s builds through major architectural improvements

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS: Hero Template BEM Migration

### **Hero System Analysis Complete** ‚úÖ
- **Working layouts identified**: Journal-hero split design used across TIER 1 & 2 pages
- **Hero-card pattern**: Successfully working for insight articles, ready for extension
- **Architecture gaps**: Mixed BEM compliance in templates, some 3-layer violations
- **Strategic approach**: Fix BEM first, then logical renaming, then extend patterns

### **Hero Usage Patterns Documented** üìä
```
TIER 1 Navigation: journal-hero split (working, needs BEM + logical renaming)
‚îú‚îÄ HOME: panel--hero centered (working)
‚îú‚îÄ Brands/Founders/Insights/Journal/About: journal-hero split (working)

TIER 2 Rollups: journal-hero split with category colors (working)
‚îú‚îÄ Insight categories: journal-hero split (working)
‚îú‚îÄ Dimension categories: not styled (will use same pattern)

TIER 3 Individual: mixed patterns (optimization opportunity)
‚îú‚îÄ Insight articles: hero-card (working, extend to profiles)
‚îú‚îÄ Brand/Founder/Dimension profiles: various (adopt hero-card)
```

### **Template BEM Migration Strategy** üîß
- **Phase 1**: BEM compliance fixes in panel hero templates (this session)
- **Phase 2**: 3-layer architecture verification and compliance
- **Phase 3**: Logical renaming (journal-hero ‚Üí split-hero)
- **Phase 4**: Extend working patterns (hero-card to profiles, split-hero to dimensions)

## üèÅ IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### **Hero Template BEM Compliance** ‚≠ê **URGENT**
1. **Fix BEM naming** in all panel hero templates (home, profiles, etc.)
2. **Verify 3-layer architecture** compliance across all hero implementations
3. **Resolve architecture violations** (hardcoded panels ‚Üí proper configuration)
4. **Document current working state** before logical renaming phase

### **Architecture Compliance Verification** üîç **CRITICAL**
- **Audit page_sections.yml** coverage for all hero usage
- **Verify page-sections.html** helper usage vs hardcoded implementations
- **Check panel-types.scss** styling separation compliance
- **Fix any bypassed architecture** found during audit

### **Foundation for Dimension Styling** üéØ **STRATEGIC**
- **Clean BEM foundation** enables effective dimension hero troubleshooting
- **Consistent architecture** eliminates CSS confusion during styling work
- **Logical naming preparation** sets stage for extending working patterns
- **Professional standards** maintained through systematic approach

---

## üìä TECHNICAL STATUS

### **BEM Compliance Architecture** ‚úÖ **MATURE**
- **CSS layer**: 94% BEM-compliant with comprehensive element modifier system
- **Template layer**: Ready for BEM adoption (legacy support maintained)
- **Documentation**: Complete BEM guidelines in technical-standards.md
- **Migration path**: Systematic template updates using proven BEM patterns

### **Panel System Completeness** ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE**
- **Hero panels**: 6 variants covering all use cases (navigation, profiles, articles)
- **Color panels**: 8 soft variants with complete palette coverage
- **Utility modifiers**: Clean BEM patterns for layout behavior
- **Design integration**: Perfect alignment with design token system

### **3-Layer Architecture Status** üîÑ **VERIFICATION NEEDED**
- **Configuration layer**: page_sections.yml defines panel mappings
- **Processing layer**: page-sections.html applies configuration
- **Styling layer**: panel-types.scss provides visual styling
- **Compliance audit**: Required to identify and fix architecture bypasses
