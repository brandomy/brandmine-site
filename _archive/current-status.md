  height: 16px;
  background: var(--neutral-300); // Inactive state
  &:hover {
    background: var(--primary-300); // Bright teal hover
    transform: scale(1.2);          // Scaling effect
  }
  transition: all 0.4s ease;       // Smooth animations

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    width: 12px; height: 12px;     // Mobile responsive
  }
}
