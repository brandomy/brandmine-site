## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONES ACHIEVED

### CSS Architecture Cleanup Complete ‚úÖ **NEW ACHIEVEMENT**
- **Phase 1**: Legacy file removal & separation of concerns - removed cards.scss, moved grid logic
- **Phase 2**: Mobile-first conversion - converted 14 desktop-first patterns to 27 mobile-first patterns
- **Phase 3**: Manifest organization - proper CSS cascade order with 44 imports organized
- **Build Performance**: Improved from 12-13s to 4.78s (consistent optimization gains)

### Component System Excellence ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**
- **Insight Category Component**: Production-ready insight-category-new.html with BEM structure
- **Card Architecture**: Clean separation - brand-card.html, insight-card.html, founder-card.html with variants
- **Mobile-First Compliance**: All card components follow 345px ‚Üí 360px ‚Üí 450px token strategy
- **Separation of Concerns**: Cards contain only intrinsic properties, layouts handle positioning

### Official Color Standards System Complete ‚úÖ **VALIDATED**
- **Insight Categories**: Orange (Brand Spotlight), Indigo (Founder's Journey), Sky Blue (Location Intelligence), Olive Green (Market Momentum)
- **Dimension Alignment**: Perfect color consistency across insight categories and dimension types
- **Component Integration**: insight-category-new.html displays official colors across all contexts
- **Architecture Compliance**: Color system validated through comprehensive cleanup

### Technical Debt Resolution ‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH**
- **Legacy CSS Removed**: Eliminated conflicting files (cards.scss, case-studies-carousel.css)
- **File Organization**: Proper component/layout separation with featured-brands-grid moved to layout/
- **Import Conflicts**: Resolved duplicate imports and missing dependencies
- **Founder Card Analysis**: Comprehensive consolidation strategy documented for future implementation
