## Impact

- **44 files** now use centralized configuration instead of custom sections
- **Front matter simplified** across all major content types
- **Maintenance reduced** - no need to update sections in multiple places
- **Consistency ensured** across all three languages
- **"Logic Light" architecture** fully implemented for these file types

## Files That Still Have Custom Sections

After Phase 2, there are still files with custom sections arrays that differ from defaults:
- Blog post files (different section order)
- Collection pages (brands, founders, insights) with custom layouts
- Dimension category pages with specialized content
- Some insight articles with unique configurations

These will be reviewed in Phase 3 to determine if they need custom sections or if defaults should be further adjusted.

## Next Steps

**Phase 3** will review the remaining files with custom sections to:
1. Identify which overrides are legitimate
2. Determine if any additional default adjustments are needed
3. Document intentional variations
4. Clean up any remaining unnecessary overrides

**Phase 4** will update templates and documentation to reflect the new centralized approach.
