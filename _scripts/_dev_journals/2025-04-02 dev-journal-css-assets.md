# Development Journal: CSS Asset Management

## Problem Statement
Optimize CSS loading and management for Brandmine site, reducing HTTP requests and improving performance through Jekyll Assets integration.

## Approach
- Consolidate CSS imports into single `site.css`
- Configure Jekyll Assets for comprehensive CSS processing
- Simplify stylesheet loading in `default.html`

## Implementation Details
### Gemfile Modifications
- Added `jekyll-assets` to plugin group
- Configured for GitHub Pages compatibility

### Configuration Updates
- Added multiple source directories for CSS:
  ```yaml
  assets:
    sources:
      - assets/css
      - assets/css/pages
      - assets/css/components
      - assets/css/layout
      - assets/css/tokens
  ```

### CSS Management
- Created `site.css` with comprehensive imports
- Removed individual stylesheet link tags
- Replaced with single `{% asset site.css %}` tag

## Decisions Made
- Prioritize single stylesheet approach
- Enable CSS compression and autoprefixing
- Maintain modular CSS directory structure

## Challenges Encountered
- Ruby gem compatibility issues
- Potential version conflicts with Jekyll Assets

## Next Actions
- Thoroughly test site performance
- Verify cross-browser stylesheet compatibility
- Monitor page load times

## Insights
- Modular CSS architecture supports easier maintenance
- Jekyll Assets provides robust static asset management
- Performance optimizations achieved through consolidated loading
