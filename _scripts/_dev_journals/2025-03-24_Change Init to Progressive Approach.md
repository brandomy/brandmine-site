The approach of "letting Claude ask for specific context when necessary" is an excellent way to optimize our conversations. It allows us to start with minimal context and add more details only when needed, making our interactions more efficient. Here's how to implement this approach:

## Implementation Strategy for Progressive Context Loading

### 1. Start with Minimal Essential Context

Begin sessions with only the most critical information:

```python
def generate_minimal_context():
    """Generate just the essential context to start a session."""
    
    # Current date for reference
    today = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
    
    minimal_context = f"""# Brandmine Jekyll Website - Quick Reference
Generated: {today}

## Project Overview
- Jekyll-based multilingual website (EN, RU, ZH)
- Focus on showcasing BRICS+ consumer brands
- Current navigation structure: Home, Brands, Discover (Sectors, Markets, Attributes, Signals), Insights, About

## Latest Development
- Most recent commit: {get_latest_commit_info()}
- Current focus: {get_current_focus_area()}

## Working with Claude
When I need more context about specific areas, please ask me and I can provide:
1. File contents (specific layouts, includes, CSS files)
2. Directory structures
3. Configuration details
4. Recent changes in specific areas
5. Tag system details
6. Translation system information

I'm new to programming and building this site myself with your guidance.
"""
    return minimal_context
```

### 2. Create a Context Menu System

Add functions to your script that organize available context into logical categories:

```python
def generate_context_menu():
    """Create a menu of available context information Claude can request."""
    
    menu = """
## Available Context Information

If needed, you can ask me for any of these context packages:

### Site Structure
- Full directory structure
- Jekyll configuration
- Collection setup

### Design System
- Color palette details
- Typography system
- Component library status

### Multilingual System
- Translation file structure
- Language implementation details
- Content translation status

### Development History
- Recent commits and changes
- Project log entries
- Current development focus

### Content Organization
- Tag system details 
- Content statistics
- Navigation structure

### Specific File Contents
- You can ask for any specific file content like:
  "Can you share your header.html include?"
  "What's in your main.css file?"
  "How is your default layout structured?"
"""
    return menu
```

### 3. Modify Your Script to Support This Approach

Update your `claude-session-init.py` script to include a new flag:

```python
parser.add_argument("--progressive", action="store_true", 
                   help="Generate minimal context with a menu of additional context Claude can request")
```

Then modify your main function:

```python
def main():
    # ... existing code ...
    
    if args.progressive:
        # Generate minimal context with menu
        context = generate_minimal_context() + "\n\n" + generate_context_menu()
    else:
        # Your existing comprehensive context generation
        context = generate_context_document(
            focus=args.focus.lower() if args.focus else None,
            full_details=args.full
        )
    
    # ... rest of your function ...
```

### 4. Prepare Context Snippets in Advance

Create a library of pre-formatted context snippets that you can quickly paste into the conversation when Claude asks for them. These could be stored in individual files in a `_context_snippets/` directory.

For example, create files like:
- `_context_snippets/multilingual_system.md`
- `_context_snippets/color_palette.md`
- `_context_snippets/tag_system.md`

### 5. Update Your Workflow

With this implemented, your workflow would be:

1. Start a new session with Claude using minimal context:
   ```
   ./claude-session-init.py --progressive --copy
   ```

2. Let Claude ask for specific context when needed:
   ```
   Claude: "Before I can answer your question about the multilingual navigation, could you share the structure of your language selector include?"
   ```

3. Respond with just the requested context:
   ```
   You: "Here's the language selector include:
   
   ```html
   <!-- _includes/language-selector.html -->
   <div class="language-selector">
     <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/{{ page.url | remove_first: page.lang }}" {% if page.lang == 'en' %}class="active"{% endif %}>EN</a>
     <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ru/{{ page.url | remove_first: page.lang }}" {% if page.lang == 'ru' %}class="active"{% endif %}>RU</a>
     <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/zh/{{ page.url | remove_first: page.lang }}" {% if page.lang == 'zh' %}class="active"{% endif %}>ZH</a>
   </div>
   ```
   ```

## Example Claude Interactions

Here's how the conversation flow might look:

---

**You:** [Initial question about improving navigation with minimal context]

**Claude:** "I'd be happy to help with navigation improvements. Before I suggest specific changes, could you share your current header.html file and the navigation CSS? That would help me understand the current structure."

**You:** "Here's the header.html:
[paste header.html content]

And here's the navigation CSS:
[paste navigation CSS]"

**Claude:** "Thanks! Now I can see how the navigation is currently implemented. Based on this, here's my suggestion for improving the dropdown behavior..."

---

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Efficiency**: Starts with minimal context to save space
2. **Relevance**: Only adds context directly relevant to the current task
3. **Adaptability**: Allows Claude to request exactly what's needed
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Helps you understand which context is most valuable for different tasks
5. **Improved Response Quality**: Claude has exactly the information needed to provide accurate answers

This approach is particularly valuable for a long-term, complex project like yours where the full context would be overwhelming, but specific pieces of context are essential for accurate assistance.
