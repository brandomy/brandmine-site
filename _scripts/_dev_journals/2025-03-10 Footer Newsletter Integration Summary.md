2025-03-10

## Overview
This document summarizes our work implementing a Mailerlite newsletter subscription form in the Brandmine website footer, maintaining the existing three-column layout while addressing several design considerations.

## Issues Considered and Solutions

### Footer Layout Structure
- **Initial State**: Three-column layout with company info, tagline/social media, and email contact
- **Goal**: Integrate newsletter signup while preserving layout
- **Solution**: Replaced email contact in right column with the newsletter form, keeping the three-column structure

### Newsletter Form Integration
- **Options Explored**: 
  - Sendpulse vs. Mailerlite integration
  - JavaScript embed vs. HTML embed
  - Translation variables vs. hardcoded text
- **Implementation Choice**: Mailerlite JavaScript integration using translation variables

### Visual Alignment Issues
- **Addressed**: 
  - Header sizing (changed from large h4 to paragraph with bold styling)
  - Copyright placement (moved to under company info in left column)
  - Text alignment (aligned "Stay Connected" with tagline)
- **Solution**: Custom CSS styling and structure reorganization

### Responsive Design
- **Considerations**: How the footer adapts to different screen sizes
- **Implementation**: Media queries to adjust grid layout for tablet and mobile views

### Translation Support
- **Approach**: Used Jekyll translation variables for all user-facing text
- **Languages**: Added English, Russian, and Chinese translations for all newsletter elements

### Technical Integration
- **Form Action**: Configured to submit to Mailerlite endpoint
- **Account ID**: Utilized account ID '1377139'
- **Form ID**: Implemented with form ID '23508572'

## Social Media Implementation

The footer includes the following social media platforms implemented as SVG icons with translation-variable URLs:

1. **Twitter/X**: X logo with link to Twitter profile
2. **LinkedIn**: LinkedIn logo with company page link
3. **Instagram**: Instagram logo with profile link
4. **Telegram**: Telegram logo with channel link
5. **YouTube**: YouTube logo with channel link
6. **Email**: Email icon with mailto link using the email address defined in translations

Technical implementation details:
- **Icons**: SVG icons embedded directly in the HTML for faster loading and styling flexibility
- **Styling**: Circular background with hover effect
- **Alignment**: Centered in the middle footer column
- **URLs**: Dynamically populated from translation variables:
  ```
  {{ site.data.translations[page.lang].footer.social_media.platform }}
  ```

## Final Implementation

The final implementation:
1. Maintains the three-column layout with proper alignment
2. Integrates Mailerlite newsletter subscription
3. Supports multilingual content through translation variables
4. Features responsive design for all screen sizes
5. Places the copyright notice under company information
6. Preserves social media links with SVG icons in the center column

This implementation provides a clean, functional footer that aligns with the Brandmine brand while offering users an easy way to subscribe to the newsletter.
