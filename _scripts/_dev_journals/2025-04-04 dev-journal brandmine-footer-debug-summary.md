## üîç Problems We Tackled

### 1. **Footer misalignment on mobile devices**
- Sections (`.footer-section-left`, `-center`, `-right`) were not fully centered or fitting the screen width
- Newsletter form area was believed to be the cause, but further testing showed all three sections had issues

### 2. **Unintended horizontal overflow**
- Caused by `width: 100%` **without** `box-sizing: border-box`
- Padding on each section pushed total width beyond the viewport

### 3. **Embedded MailerLite form not centering**
- The embedded `.ml-embedded` form didn't respond predictably to flexbox
- Looked misaligned even when its parent was centered correctly

### 4. **Unnecessary or ineffective flex styles**
- `justify-content: center` was being applied where it had no visual effect (e.g., in vertically stacking content)
- Flexbox was overused in places where classic block layout was more predictable

### 5. **Redundant use of `.container`**
- Consideration whether the footer should be wrapped again in a `.container`
- We determined this was not needed for your current full-width layout approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

### ‚úÖ Diagnosed with DevTools and flex/grid overlays
- Used device emulation and box model inspection to identify overflow and alignment bugs

### ‚úÖ Cleaned up mobile media queries
- Consolidated section styling for:
  ```css
  .footer-section,
  .footer-section-left,
  .footer-section-center,
  .footer-section-right
  ```

- Applied:
  - `width: 100%`
  - `padding: 0 var(--space-4)`
  - `text-align: center`
  - `box-sizing: border-box`

### ‚úÖ Improved structural clarity
- Switched newsletter container from flexbox to classic block layout on mobile
- Wrapped MailerLite in `.newsletter-wrapper` to safely apply styling without touching the shadow DOM

### ‚úÖ Scoped embed-specific overrides
- Added fallback styles like:
  ```css
  .ml-embedded {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  ```

## üß± What We Accomplished

- üì± Mobile layout now fits screen width without visual shifts
- üéØ Footer sections align properly in both mobile and desktop views
- üì¶ MailerLite form behaves more predictably
- üßº Removed unneeded flex logic and margin overrides
- ‚ú® Footer now structured for future scaling and responsive design best practices

---

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaways

- `box-sizing: border-box` is essential for mobile layout sanity
- Use `margin: auto` + `display: block` for centering third-party embedded blocks
- Flex is powerful, but best used when you control all child layout behavior
- Full-width footers should **not** use `.container` unless you're intentionally constraining the width

---

**Next steps (optional):**
- Audit other sections (like `.container`) across the site for consistency
- Modularize and comment `footer.css` with reusable utility classes
- Consider migrating to SCSS for breakpoint nesting and cleaner structure in the future
