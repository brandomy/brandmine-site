# Brandmine Development Summary - March 7, 2025

## Today's Achievements

Today we focused on enhancing the homepage content and improving the header layout for the Brandmine multilingual website. We made significant progress in several key areas:

### 1. Homepage Content Enhancement

We updated the homepage content for all three language versions (English, Russian, and Chinese) with more compelling messaging that clearly communicates Brandmine's value proposition. The new content includes:

- A refined headline: "Amplifying the Brands of the BRICS+"
- An engaging introductory paragraph explaining Brandmine's purpose
- A clear mission statement section highlighting how Brandmine helps brands grow beyond borders
- A market potential section with compelling statistics (40% of global population, 25% of worldwide GDP)
- A contact section with a call-to-action button: "Get in on the Ground Floor"

The content was carefully translated into Russian and Chinese, maintaining cultural appropriateness while conveying the same key messaging points.

### 2. Header Layout Improvement

We improved the site header layout by repositioning the language selector to the right side of the navigation bar. This was accomplished by:

- Adding flexbox styling to the header container
- Applying proper spacing and alignment for the site title, navigation, and language selector
- Ensuring the layout is responsive for different screen sizes
- Making the language selector more visually distinct with improved hover states

The CSS changes were implemented in the `basic-colors.css` file, enhancing both the functionality and visual appearance of the header.

### 3. Git Workflow and Deployment

We practiced an effective Git workflow through:

- Modifying source files locally
- Testing changes with `bundle exec jekyll build` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Committing changes with descriptive messages (e.g., "adjust menu bar language switcher")
- Pushing to the GitHub repository
- Verifying successful deployment through GitHub Actions
- Troubleshooting deployment and caching issues

We also improved the Git configuration by updating the `.gitignore` file to exclude macOS system files (`.DS_Store`), keeping the repository clean and focused on actual website files.

## Next Steps

Building on today's progress, potential next steps include:

1. Further enhancing the homepage with sector showcases or featured brands
2. Implementing brand profile pages based on the Airtable database
3. Setting up the MapLibre integration for geographic visualization
4. Adding analytics to track user behavior for customer discovery
5. Continuing to refine the multilingual content and user experience

The foundation we've established today will serve as a solid base for these upcoming improvements as we continue to develop the Brandmine MVP.
