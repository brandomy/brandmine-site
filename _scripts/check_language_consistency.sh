#
# This script checks for language consistency across the Brandmine Jekyll site.
# It verifies that each content page has corresponding versions in English, Russian, and Chinese,
# helping maintain a fully localized and professional site structure.
#
# Key Features:
# - Scans all Markdown and HTML files in the 'pages' directory.
# - Detects missing language versions based on folder structure.
# - Generates a CSV report highlighting inconsistencies.
# - Provides a quick console summary for immediate feedback.
#
# Usage:
#     bash check_language_consistency.sh
