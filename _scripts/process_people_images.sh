#
# This script processes people/team member images for the Brandmine Jekyll site.
# It generates responsive versions of all people images with appropriate
# sizing for portraits and team photos.
#
# Key Features:
# - Optimized for portrait-orientation photos
# - Higher quality preservation for faces
# - Generates multiple sizes (400w, 800w, 1200w) for responsive usage
# - Validates aspect ratios for consistency
#
# Usage:
#     bash process_people_images.sh
