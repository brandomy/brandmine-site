## A Bold Countercurrent in Hospitality

As global hospitality chains continue their urban focus, Russia's premier hospitality group has spent the past three years executing a strategy that bucks conventional wisdom. Ginza Project, long known for its upscale restaurants and hotels in Moscow and St. Petersburg, has completed an ambitious expansion into rural Russia with its "Dacha Collection"—a network of 15 boutique properties in remote locations that is transforming the landscape of Russian luxury hospitality.

The completion of the final property—Sosnovy Bor, a 24-suite retreat nestled in the forests near Lake Baikal—marks a significant milestone not just for the company but for the entire Russian hospitality sector. With an investment exceeding 12 billion rubles ($150 million), the Dacha Collection represents one of the largest private investments in rural Russian tourism infrastructure in the post-Soviet era.

"When we announced this strategy in 2022, many industry analysts were skeptical," acknowledges Anton Pinskiy, Ginza Project's CEO. "The conventional wisdom was that luxury hospitality in Russia needed to be concentrated in major cities and established tourist destinations. We saw an opportunity to pioneer something different—authentic luxury experiences that showcase the natural beauty and cultural richness of rural Russia."

## Redefining the Russian Retreat

The Dacha Collection takes its name from the traditional Russian country house, a central element of Russian cultural life for centuries. Historically, dachas ranged from humble wooden cottages to grand estates, serving as seasonal retreats where urbanites could reconnect with nature and tradition.

Ginza Project has reimagined this concept for the 21st century, creating properties that combine authentic architectural elements with contemporary luxury and world-class amenities. Each location emphasizes connection to its natural surroundings and local cultural traditions while maintaining the service standards expected by international luxury travelers.

"We didn't want to simply build Western-style resorts in Russian settings," explains Maria Ivanova, Ginza Project's Chief Design Officer. "Each property is an interpretation of traditional regional architecture, adapted for modern comfort. We worked with local artisans and cultural historians to ensure authenticity in everything from construction techniques to interior details."

This commitment to authenticity extends beyond architecture. Each property features restaurants serving sophisticated interpretations of regional cuisine, spa treatments incorporating local wellness traditions, and activities that connect guests with the surrounding culture and landscape.

## Economic Impact Beyond Tourism

The economic impact of the Dacha Collection extends far beyond direct tourism revenue. By establishing luxury destinations in regions traditionally outside mainstream tourist routes, Ginza Project has created significant employment opportunities in areas often challenged by urban migration.

"Each property employs between 50 and 120 people, with approximately 70% hired locally," notes Sergei Marinin, Ginza Project's Director of Human Resources. "We've invested heavily in training programs, partnering with regional educational institutions to develop hospitality skills among local populations."

These programs have created career pathways in communities where employment options were previously limited to agriculture, resource extraction, or migration to urban centers. At the Karelian property, Lesnoy Bereg, the average salary of staff is 2.3 times the regional average, creating a significant economic multiplier effect in the surrounding villages.

Beyond direct employment, the properties have stimulated local supply chains and artisanal industries. The company's "50 Kilometer Kitchen" policy requires each property to source at least 70% of food ingredients from within 50 kilometers, creating reliable markets for local farmers and food producers.

"Before the resort opened, I was considering abandoning my family's cheese-making business," says Nikolai Kuznetsov, who supplies traditional cheeses to the Lesnoy Bereg property. "Now we've expanded production, hired two additional staff, and are at capacity with consistent year-round orders."

Similar stories can be found across all 15 locations, where the resorts have revitalized traditional crafts by commissioning local artisans for furnishings, decorative elements, and guest amenities. In several locations, artisan villages have developed around the properties, creating additional tourist attractions and income sources for local communities.

## Technological Innovation in Remote Settings

Developing luxury properties in remote locations presented significant technical challenges, particularly regarding sustainability and connectivity. Ginza Project's solutions to these challenges have established new standards for environmentally responsible luxury development in challenging settings.

"Operating off the main power grid and municipal systems required us to develop comprehensive sustainability solutions," explains Technical Director Pavel Sorokin. "We've essentially created self-sufficient systems that minimize environmental impact while maintaining luxury service levels."

Each property utilizes a combination of solar, wind, and in some cases small-scale hydroelectric generation, with advanced battery systems ensuring consistent power regardless of conditions. Sophisticated water management systems, including rainwater harvesting and blackwater treatment, minimize freshwater consumption while avoiding pollution of surrounding ecosystems.

Perhaps most impressively, the company has solved the connectivity challenges that often plague remote destinations. Through partnerships with telecommunications providers and satellite services, each property offers enterprise-grade internet that allows guests to remain connected while enjoying remote natural settings.

"The technical infrastructure is invisible to guests, as it should be in a luxury context," notes Sorokin. "But behind the scenes, we're operating some of the most advanced self-sufficient systems in the hospitality industry. Several of our solutions have been patented and are now being licensed to other developers facing similar challenges."

## Cultural Preservation Through Tourism

Beyond economic and environmental impacts, the Dacha Collection is making significant contributions to cultural preservation in the regions where it operates. Each property includes a Cultural Heritage Center that documents and celebrates local traditions, from historical crafts to musical forms and folkloric practices.

"Many regional cultural traditions were at risk of being lost as younger generations moved to cities," explains Cultural Director Elena Volkova. "By creating economic value around these traditions, we're helping preserve them for future generations."

The company employs cultural anthropologists who work with local communities to document traditions and identify opportunities to incorporate them authentically into the guest experience. In several locations, this has led to the revival of nearly-forgotten crafts and celebrations.

At the Altai property, Gornoe Nebo, the opening of the resort coincided with the first celebration of a traditional seasonal festival in over 60 years. The company worked with village elders to document the traditional elements of the celebration and supported its revival, which now serves as both a community gathering and a unique experience for guests.

"We see ourselves as cultural stewards as much as hospitality providers," says Volkova. "If these traditions disappear, something precious is lost not just for Russia but for global cultural heritage."

## International Reception and Future Directions

With all 15 properties now operational, the Dacha Collection has begun attracting international attention. Occupancy rates have exceeded projections, averaging 78% across all properties in the first full year of operation, with surprisingly strong interest from international travelers.

"We're seeing guests from throughout Asia, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, as well as Europe and the Middle East," notes Marketing Director Alexei Turgenev. "What's striking is the demographic—these aren't budget travelers but sophisticated luxury consumers seeking authentic experiences they can't find elsewhere."

The success of the collection has prompted Ginza Project to announce preliminary plans for five additional properties, potentially including locations in the Far East and Arctic regions. The company is also exploring management contracts for privately-owned properties seeking to join the collection's reservation system and brand standards.

Industry recognition has been equally strong, with the collection receiving 47 awards in its first year, including three properties being admitted to Leading Hotels of the World and two to Relais & Châteaux. The Sosnovy Bor property was recently named "New Property of the Year" by Condé Nast Traveler's Russian edition.

"What Ginza Project has achieved is remarkable not just for Russia but for global hospitality," observes Mikhail Fedorov, hospitality analyst at Moscow's RBC Capital. "They've created a new category that combines the authenticity of traditional culture with the refinement of world-class luxury. It's a model that could be adapted to many other countries with rich cultural traditions outside their urban centers."

As the collection completes its initial phase, it stands as a powerful example of how hospitality development can simultaneously preserve cultural heritage, stimulate rural economies, and create unique experiences for travelers seeking deeper connections to the places they visit. In looking beyond city centers to the spectacular landscapes and rich traditions of rural Russia, Ginza Project has not just expanded its business but potentially reshaped the future direction of Russian tourism.
