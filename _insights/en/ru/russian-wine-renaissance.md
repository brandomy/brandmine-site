## A New Direction for Russian Spirits

While European markets have traditionally been the primary destination for Russian spirit exporters, the past 18 months have seen a remarkable shift. Premium craft distilleries across Russia are finding unprecedented success in East Asian luxury markets, particularly in China, Japan, and South Korea.

Industry data shows that exports of Russian craft spirits to East Asia increased by 78% in 2024, with especially strong growth in the ultra-premium segment priced above $100 per bottle. This growth comes at a critical time when traditional export routes have faced logistical and regulatory challenges.

"Initially, we viewed Asian markets as a secondary opportunity," explains Dmitry Voronin, CEO of Siberian Distillery. "Now they represent more than 40% of our export revenue and are growing faster than any other region."
