    - ref: "ru-teatime"                    # Must match brand filename
      title: "TeaTime"                     # Display name
      permalink: "/en/brands/ru-teatime/"  # Full URL path
      
      # STRATEGIC CONTENT (Required for 8/10 effectiveness)
      value_proposition: "Moscow's premium tea house bringing authentic Russian tea culture to global markets"
      founder_display_name: "Alexei Sokolov"
      founder_role: "CEO & Tea Master"
      
      # KEY METRIC (Business credibility)
      key_metric:

        value: "23 Countries"             # Impressive number
        period: "Since 2015"              # Time context

      market: ["ru"]                      # Country code for market helpers
      founding_year: 1998

### Writing Effective Value Propositions

**Formula:** [Location/Origin] + [Category] + [Unique Benefit] + [Market Opportunity]

**Good Examples:**

**Avoid:**
- Generic statements: "We make great products"
- Industry jargon: "Leading solutions provider"
- Vague benefits: "High quality manufacturer"

### Key Metrics That Work

  value: "23 Countries"
  period: "Since 2015"

# Growth indicators  
key_metric:
  label: "Revenue Growth"
  value: "300% YoY"
  period: "2022-2024"

# Achievement indicators
key_metric:
  label: "Partner Farms"
  value: "28 Families"
  period: "Since 1986"
```

### Breakthrough Moments

**Focus on specific, measurable achievements:**
- "Featured in Harrods London, reaching 23 countries"
- "Achieved organic certification and expanded to 50 beehive locations"
- "First Russian tea brand to achieve international certification"

**Avoid generic statements:**

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
```bash
# Check YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('_data/featured_content.yml'))"

# Check Jekyll doctor
bundle exec jekyll doctor
```

**Images Not Displaying**
- Verify file paths match exactly
- Check image processing completed: `_scripts/process_images.sh [collection] [identifier]`
- Ensure correct aspect ratios (3:2 for heroes, 2:3 for portraits)

**Cards Not Showing Strategic Content**
- Verify `featured: true` in data files
- Check translation keys exist in all language files
- Ensure proper indentation in YAML files

**Performance Issues**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild if build time > 20 seconds
bundle exec jekyll clean
bundle exec jekyll build

# Check for circular references or large files
```

### Validation Checklist

Before publishing new content:

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Strategic content displays on cards
- [ ] All three languages work (EN/RU/ZH)
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] CTAs function properly
- [ ] Translation keys are complete

### Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Missing value proposition | Add to `featured_content.yml` |
| No founder image | Check image processing and file paths |
| Wrong card colors | Verify category matches taxonomy |
| Missing translations | Add keys to all three language files |
| Broken layout | Check YAML indentation and syntax |
